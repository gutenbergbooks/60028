</div>

<p class="dropcap">I have been asked to open the front door
of this book. But I must not keep you
standing too long on the threshold. The
picture-gallery, the banqueting hall and
the throne-room are inside. All the fascinations
of romance are, by the able author, thrown around
the facts of Mary’s life. Much-abused tradition is
also called in for splendid service. The pen that
the author wields is experienced, graceful, captivating,
and multipotent. As perhaps no other book
that was ever written, this one will show us woman as
standing at the head of the world. It demonstrates in
the life of Mary what woman was and what woman
may be. Woman’s position in the world is higher
than man’s; and although she has often been denied
the right of suffrage, she always does vote and always
will vote—by her influence; and her chief desire ought
to be that she should have grace rightly to rule in the
dominion which she has already won.</p>

<p>She has no equal as a comforter of the sick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
What land, what street, what house has not felt the
smitings of disease? Tens of thousands of sick beds!
What shall we do with them? Shall man, with his
rough hand, and heavy foot, and impatient bearing,
minister? No; he cannot soothe the pain. He can
not quiet the nerves. He knows not where to set the
light. His hand is not steady enough to pour out the
drops. He is not wakeful enough to be watcher. You
have known men who have despised women, but the
moment disease fell upon them, they did not send for
their friends at the bank or their worldly associates.
Their first cry was, “Take me to my wife.” The dissipated
young man at the college scoffs at the idea of
being under home influence; but at the first blast
of typhoid fever on his cheek he says, “Where is
mother?” I think one of the most pathetic passages
in all the Bible is the description of the lad who went
out to the harvest fields of Shunem and got sunstruck;
throwing his hands on his temples, and crying out,
“Oh, my head! my head!” and they said, “Carry
him to his mother.” And the record is “He sat on
her knees till noon and then died.”</p>

<p>In the war men cast the cannon, men fashioned the
muskets, men cried to the hosts “Forward, march!”
men hurled their battalions on the sharp edges of
the enemy, crying “Charge! charge!” but woman
scraped the lint, woman administered the cordials,
woman watched by the dying couch, woman wrote
the last message to the home circle, woman wept
at the solitary burial, attended by herself and four
men with a spade. Men did their work with shot
and shell, and carbine and howitzer; women did their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
work with socks and slippers, and bandages, and warm
drinks, and scripture texts, and gentle soothings of the
hot temples, and stories of that land where they
never have any pain. Men knelt down over the
wounded and said, “On which side did you fight?”
Women knelt down over the wounded and said,
“Where are you hurt? What nice thing can I make
for you to eat? What makes you cry?” To-night,
while we men are soundly asleep in our beds, there
will be a light in yonder loft; there will be groaning
down that dark alley; there will be cries of distress in
that cellar. Men will sleep and women will watch.</p>

<p>No one as well as a woman can handle the poor.
There are hundreds and thousands of them in all our
cities. There is a kind of work that men cannot do
for the destitute. Man sometimes gives his charity
in a rough way, and it falls like the fruit of a tree
in the East, which fruit comes down so heavily
that it breaks the skull of the man who is trying
to gather it. But woman glides so softly into the
house of want, and finds out all the sorrows of
the place, and puts so quietly the donation on the
table, that all the family come out on the front steps
as she departs, expecting that from under her shawl
she will thrust out two wings and go right up to
Heaven, from whence she seems to have come down.
O, Christian young woman, if you would make yourself
happy and win the blessings of Christ, go out
among the poor! A loaf of bread or a bundle of
socks may make a homely load to carry, but the angels
of God will come out to watch, and the Lord Almighty
will give His messenger hosts a charge, saying, “Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
after that woman, canopy her with your wings, and
shelter her from all harm.” And while you are seated
in the house of destitution and suffering, the little
ones around the room will whisper, “Who is she? is
she not beautiful?” and if you will listen right sharply,
you will hear dripping through the leaky roof, and
rolling over the broken stairs, the angel chant that
shook Bethlehem: “Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace and good will to man.” Can you tell
why a Christian woman, going down among the haunts
of iniquity on a Christian errand, seldom meets with
any indignity?</p>

<p>I stood in the chapel of Helen Chalmers, the daughter
of the celebrated Dr. Chalmers, in the most abandoned
part of the city of Edinburg; and I said to her,
as I looked around upon the fearful surroundings of
that place, “Do you come here nights to hold a
service?” “Oh, yes,” she said; “I take my lantern
and I go through all these haunts of sin, the darkest
and the worst; and I ask all the men and women to
come to the chapel, and then I sing for them, and I
pray for them, and I talk to them.” I said, “Can it be
possible that you never meet with an insult while performing
this Christian errand?” “Never,” she said;
“never.” That young woman, who has her father by
her side, walking down the street, and an armed policeman
at each corner is not so well defended as that
Christian woman who goes forth on Gospel work into
the haunts of iniquity carrying the Bible and bread.</p>

<p>Some one said, “I dislike very much to see that
Christian woman teaching these bad boys in the
mission school. I am afraid to have her instruct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
them.” “So,” said another man, “I am afraid too.”
Said the first, “I am afraid they will use vile language
before they leave the place.” “Ah,” said the other
man, “I am not afraid of that; what I am afraid of is,
that if any of those boys should use a bad word in her
presence, the other boys would tear him to pieces—killing
him on the spot.”</p>

<p>Woman is especially endowed to soothe disaster
She is called the weaker vessel, but all profane as well
as sacred history attests that when the crisis comes she
is better prepared than man to meet the emergency.
How often have you seen a woman who seemed to be
a disciple of frivolity and indolence, who, under
one stroke of calamity, changed to be a heroine.
There was a crisis in your affairs, you struggled
bravely and long, but after a while there came a
day when you said, “Here I shall have to stop;”
and you called in your partners, and you called
in the most prominent men in your employ, and
you said, “We have got to stop.” You left the
store suddenly; you could hardly make up your
mind to pass through the street and over on the
ferry-boat; you felt everybody would be looking at you
and blaming you and denouncing you. You hastened
home; you told your wife all about the affair. What
did she say? Did she play the butterfly; did she talk
about the silks and the ribbons and the fashions? No;
she came up to the emergency; she quailed not under
the stroke. She helped you to begin to plan right
away. She offered to go out of the comfortable house
into a smaller one, and wear the old cloak another
winter. She was one who understood your affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
without blaming you. You looked upon what you
thought was a thin, weak woman’s arm holding you
up; but while you looked at that arm there came into
the feeble muscles of it the strength of the eternal
God. No chiding. No fretting. No telling you
about the beautiful house of her father, from which
you brought her, ten, twenty, or thirty years ago.
You said, “Well, this is the happiest day of my
life. I am glad I have got from under my burden.
My wife don’t care—I don’t care.” At the moment
you were utterly exhausted, God sent a Deborah
to meet the host of the Amalekites and scatter
them like chaff over the plain. There are scores
and hundreds of households to-day where as much
bravery and courage are demanded of woman as was
exhibited by Grace Darling or Marie Antoinette or
Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>Woman is further endowed to bring us into the
Kingdom of Heaven. It is easier for a woman to be a
Christian than for a man. Why? You say she is
weaker. No. Her heart is more responsive to the
pleadings of divine love. The fact that she can more
easily become a Christian, I prove by the statement
that three-fourths of the members of the churches in
all Christendom are women. So God appoints them
to be the chief agencies for bringing this world back to
God. The greatest sermons are not preached on
celebrated platforms; they are preached with an audience
of two or three and in private home-life. A
patient, loving, Christian demeanor in the presence of
transgression, in the presence of hardness, in the presence
of obduracy and crime, is an argument from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
throne of the Lord Almighty; and blessed is that
woman who can wield such an argument. A sailor
came slipping down the ratlin one night as though
something had happened, and the sailors cried,
“What’s the matter?” He said, “My mother’s
prayers haunt me like a ghost.”</p>

<p>In what a realm is every mother the queen. The
eagles of heaven can not fly across that dominion.
Horses, panting and with lathered flanks, are not swift
enough to run to the outpost of that realm, and
death itself will only be the annexation of heavenly
principalities. When you want your grandest idea
of a queen you do not think of Catherine of
Russia, or of Anne of England, or Maria Theresa
of Germany: but when you want to get your grandest
idea of a queen you think of the plain woman
who sat opposite your father at the table or walked
with him, arm in arm, down life’s pathway; sometimes
to the Thanksgiving banquet, sometimes to
the grave, but always together; soothing your petty
griefs, correcting your childish waywardness, joining
in your infantile sports, listening to your evening
prayer, toiling for you with needle or at the spinning
wheel, and on cold nights wrapping you up snug and
warm; and then, at last, on that day when she lay in
the back room dying, and you saw her take those thin
hands with which she had toiled for you so long, and
put them together in a dying prayer that commended
you to the God whom she had taught you to trust—oh,
she was the queen! The chariots of God came
down to fetch her, and as she went in, all heaven rose
up. You can not think of her now without a rush of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
tenderness that stirs the deep foundations of your
soul, and you feel as much a child again as when you
cried on her lap; and if you could bring her back to
life again to speak, just once more, your name as tenderly
as she used to speak it, you would be willing to
throw yourself on the ground and kiss the sod that
covers her, crying, “Mother! mother!” Ah, she was
the queen!</p>

<p>Home influences are the mightiest of all influences
upon the soul. There are men who have maintained
their integrity, not because they were any better
naturally than some other people, but because there
were home influences praying for them all the time.
They got a good start. They were launched on the
world with the benedictions of a Christian mother.
They may track Siberian snows, they may plunge
into African jungles, they may fly to the earth’s end,
they can not go so far and so fast but the prayer will
keep up with them. Oh, what a multitude of women
in heaven. Mary, Christ’s mother, in heaven. Elizabeth
Fry in heaven. Charlotte Elizabeth in heaven.
The mother of Augustine in heaven. The Countess
of Huntingdon is in heaven—who sold her splendid
jewels to build chapels—in heaven; while a great
many others who have never been heard of on
earth, or known but little of, have gone into the
rest and peace of heaven. What a rest. What a
change it was from the small room with no fire
and one window, the glass broken out, and the
aching side and worn out eyes, to the “house of many
mansions.” Heaven for aching heads. Heaven for
broken hearts. Heaven for anguish-bitten frames.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
No more sitting up until midnight for the coming
of staggering steps. No more rough blows on the
temples. No more sharp, keen, bitter curses.</p>

<p>Some of you will have no rest in this world; it will
be toil and struggle all the way up. You will have to
stand at your door fighting back the wolf with your
own hand red with carnage. But God has a crown for
you. He is now making it, and whenever you weep a
tear, He sets another gem in that crown; whenever
you have a pang of body or soul, He puts another gem
in that crown, until after a while in all the tiara there
will be no room for another splendor; and God will
say to his angel, “The crown is done; let her up that
she may wear it.” And as the Lord of righteousness
puts the crown upon your brow, angel will cry to
angel, “Who is she?” and Christ will say, “I will
tell you who she is; she is the one that came up out
of great tribulation and had her robe washed and made
white in the blood of the Lamb.” And then God will
spread a banquet, and He will invite all the principalities
of heaven to sit at the feast, and the tables will
blush with the best clusters from the vineyards of God
and crimson with the twelve manner of fruits from the
tree of life, and water from the fountains of the rock
will flash from the golden tankards; and the old
harpers of heaven will sit there, making music with
their harps, and Christ will point you out amid the
celebrities of heaven, saying, “She suffered with me
on earth, now we are going to be glorified together.”
And the banquetters, no longer able to hold their
peace, will break forth with congratulation. “Hail!
hail!” And there will be a handwriting on the wall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
not such as struck the Persian noblemen with horror,
but with fire-tipped fingers writing in blazing capitals
of light and love and victory: “God has wiped away
all tears from all faces.”</p>

<p>And now I leave you in the hands of Dr. Walsh,
the author of this book. He will show you Mary, the
model of all womanly, wifely, motherly excellence—the
Madonna hanging in the Louvre of admiration for
all Christendom, and for many millions in the higher
Vatican of their worship.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><i>Master, we would see a sign from Thee</i>,
was the cunning challenge of the Scribes
and Pharisees. They were certain that, in
this at least, the hearts of the people
would be with them. A sign, a scene, a symbol, were
the constant demand and quest of the olden times, as of
all times. Even Jehovah led forth to victory and trust,
as necessity was upon Him in leading human followers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
“with an <i>outstretched arm</i>, and with <i>signs</i> and with <i>wonders</i>.”
The Jews, seemingly so doubtful and so querulous,
after all articulated the longings of the universal
humanity. The longing stimulated the effort to gratify
it, and forthwith the artist became the teacher of the
people. Presentments of Mary, as she might have been,
and as she was imagined to have been by those most
devout, were multiplied. Piety sought to express its
regard for her by making her more real to faith through
the instrumentality of the speaking canvas, but beyond
this there was the desire to embody certain charms and
virtues of character dear to all pure and devout ones.
These were expressed by pictured faces, ideally perfect.
They called each such “Mary”; and if there had never
been a real Mary, still these handiworks would have had
no small value. Who can say that those consecrated
artists were in no degree moved by the Spirit which
guided David when “he opened dark sayings on the
harp,” and rapturously extolled that other Beloved of
God, the Church? Music and painting—twin sisters—equal
in merit, and both from Him who displays
form, color and harmony as among the chief rewards
and glories of His upper kingdom. These also meet a
want in human nature as God created it. The artists
did not beget this desire for presentments through
form and color of the woman deemed most blessed;
the desire rather begot the artists. Stately theology has
never ceased truly to proclaim from the day Christ cried
“<i>It is finished!</i>” that “<i>in Him all fullness dwells</i>;” but
no theology, has been able to silence the cry of woman’s
heart in woman and woman’s nature in man which
pleads through the long years, “<i>Show us the mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
it sufficeth us</i>.” It has happened sometimes that gross
minds have strayed from the ideal or spiritual imports
of Mary’s life and fallen into idolizing her effigies. That
was their fault, and must not be taken as full proof that
nothing but evil came from the portrayings of our
queen. The facts are conclusively otherwise. The
painters that made glorious ideals shine forth from the
canvas unconsciously painted the shadows largely out
of the conditions of all women. Before this second
advent of the Virgin, the paganish idea that women
were the “weaker sex,” the inferiors of men, at best
only useful, handsome animals, prevailed. The
renaissance of Mary, as the ideal woman, was an event
seeded with the germs of revolutionary impulses
socially. Like sunrise it began in the East, at first
dimly manifest, then it became effulgent and quickly
coursed westward along the pathways of Christianity’s
conquests. Like sweet, grateful light then there came
to the hearts of men the braver true persuasion, that
the woman who not only bore the Christ but won
His reverent love must have been morally beautiful
and great. In the track of this persuasion, and as its
sequence, there came the conviction that the sex,
of which Mary was one, had within it possibilities beyond
what its sturdier companions had dreamed.
After this it came about that the painters, often the
interpreters of human feelings, began to represent all
goodness under the form of a Madonna. Not knowing
the contour of Mary’s face they began gathering
here and there, from the women they knew, features of
beauty. They combined these in one harmonious presentment.
They set out to represent the ideal woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
but had to go to women to find her parts. It became
a tribute to womankind to do this. It was like a voyage
of discovery, and the artist voyagers depicted not
only the best things in womankind, but by putting
these things together illustrated what woman could be
and should be at her best.</p>

<p>It was thus that Guido produced a picture of the
Madonna which enravished all that beheld it. Once
he had said, “I wish I’d the wings of an angel to
behold the beatified spirits, which I might have
copied.” After, here and there, he picked out fragments
of color and form on earth; then put them into
one ideal composition. It was a heart-expanding
work; the work of a prophet, since it told of what
might be in woman wholly at her best. Then he said,
“the beautiful and pure idea must be in the head” of
the artist. It was a deep saying. Given the ideal,
and the worker will need only proper ambition to present
a grand composition, whether on canvas or in the
patternings of the inner life. The presentments of the
Virgin rose in fineness when priests turned from their
exegesis to kneel and paint for men. The great Saint
Augustine, held in high honor by Christians of every
name, redeemed from a youth of darkest sinning,
revered as his guiding star two lovely women, Monica,
his mother, and Mary, the mother of Jesus. He
argues, in stalwart polemics, that through the acknowledgment
of Mary’s pre-eminence all womankind was
elevated. Her presentment, so as to be fully comprehended,
was in the beginning a blessing to every soul
in being an inspiration to purer, sweeter living. So
far as such presentment now conserves the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
results the work is worthy and profitable. In all
times the representations of the Virgin, whether by
the historian or the master of the studio, varied; but
the piety they awakened always seemed to be of one
type, and that lofty. Thus we have “the stern, awful
quietude of the old Mosaics, the hard lifelessness of
the degenerate Greeks, the pensive sentiment of the
Siena, the stately elegance of the Florentine Madonnas,
the intellectual Milanese, with their large foreheads
and thoughtful eyes, the tender, refined mysticism
of the Umbrian, the sumptuous loveliness of
the Venetian; the quaint, characteristic simplicity of
the early German, so stamped with their nationality
that I never looked round me in a room full of German
girls without thinking of Albert Durer’s Virgins;
the intense, life-like feeling of the Spanish, the prosaic,
portrait-like nature of the Flemish schools, and so on.”
Each time and place produced its own ideal, but all
tried to express the one thought uppermost; pious
regard for the Queen and model. All seemed to feel
that in this devotion there was somehow comfort and
exaltation—and there generally were both.</p>

<p>The writer of the foregoing quotation, a woman of
widest culture and admirable good sense, attested the
need that many feel by her own rapturous description
of the Madonna of Raphael in the Dresden Gallery.
“I have seen my own ideal once where Raphael—inspired,
if ever painter was inspired—projected on
the space before him that wonderful creation.”
“There she stands, the transfigured woman; at once
completely human and completely divine, an abstraction
of power, purity and love; poised on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
empurpled air, and requiring no other support;
with melancholy, loving mouth, her slightly dilated
sibylline eyes looking out quite through the universe
to the end and consummation of all things; sad, as if
she beheld afar off the visionary sword that was to
reach her heart through <span class="smcap">him</span>, now resting as enthroned
on that heart; yet already exalted through the homage
of the redeemed generations who were to salute
her as blessed. Is it so indeed? Is she so divine? or
does not rather the imagination lend a grace that is
not there? I have stood before it and confessed that
there is more in that form and face than I have ever
yet conceived. The <i>Madonna di San Sisto</i> is an
abstract of <i>all</i> the attributes of Mary.”</p>

<p>The foregoing representation marked a step forward
in things spiritual. Before Raphael, painters numberless,
under the influence of the luxurious and vicious
Medici, had filled the churches of Florence with painted
presentments of the Virgin, characterized by an alluring
beauty which seemed next door to blasphemy.
Then came that Luther of his times, Savonarola. He
thundered for purity, simplicity and reform; aiming
his blows at the depraving, sensuous conceptions of
the grosser artists. He made a bonfire in the Piazza
of Florence, there consuming these false madonnas.
He was, for this, persecuted to death by the Borgia
family. They could not bear his trumpet call to Florentines,
“Your sins make me a prophet; I have been a
Jonah warning Nineveh; I shall be a Jeremiah weeping
over the ruins; for God will renew His church and
that will not take place without blood—” Art heard
his voice, the painters became disgusted with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
meaner handiwork, the rude, the obscene, the mischievous
was obliterated; finer, more spiritual and
loftier concepts of the Virgin appeared as proof of a
reformation of morals. And Raphael, later on, seeing
these productions, felt the influence that begot them,
and then produced that masterpiece. Tradition says
Saint Luke painted a picture of the Virgin from life.
The picture, reputed to have been so painted, was
found by the Turks in Constantinople when that city
fell into their conquering hands. They despoiled it of
its princely jewel-decorations, then tramped it contemptuously
beneath their feet. The latter act was
typical, and the Turk still lives to trample in contempt
on honest efforts to portray with amplitude and finished
details this splendid character, whose outlines
alone are presented by the Gospels. But though the
Vandal spirit survives, there survives also the strong
yearning for the representation of that woman beyond
compare, and some will still revel amid the ideals of
painters, and some will be gladdened still more by
truth’s complete presentment which words alone can
make.</p>

<p class="dropcap">There is something very fascinating about
the contemplation of life as a continuous
pilgrimage, and the fascination grows on
one as the conviction of the truth of the
conception is deepened by study of it. The course of
our race has been a series of processions from continent
to continent, from age to age, from barbarism to refinement,
from darkness toward light. Whether measuring
the little arcs of individuals from birth to dust, or following
along the mighty marches of our universe with all
its grouping hosts of whirling constellations, we have
before us ever this constant truth; man moves willingly
or unwillingly onward, as a pilgrim amid pilgrims.
“Move on” is the constant mandate and
necessity of being. Man’s course is mapped;
onward from the swaddling clothes to the shroud, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
life to dust; then onward again; while all the mighty
planet fleets of which the earth-ship is but one, move
along their courses, over trackless oceans, toward destinations,
all unknown, yet concededly in a grand as
well as in an inexorable pilgrimage. Partly because
the motions of his earth-ship makes him restless, partly
because he is a being that hopes and so comes to try
to find by distant quests hope’s fruitions, and more
largely because he is of a religious nature, which
impels him to seek things beyond himself, the man
becomes a pilgrim. He that is content as and where
he is, always, is regarded as a fool playing with the
toys of a child, by wise men; by religionists, lack of
holy restlessness is ever adjudged to be a sign of
depravity. Hence almost all religions, whether false
or true, have given birth to the pilgrim spirit. The
zeal to express and to utilize this spirit has been
often pitiful to behold. Multitudes, failing to grasp
the fact that life itself is a pilgrimage, have invented
other pilgrimages and gone aside to useless, needless
miseries. But all the time they attested human
nature seeking something beyond itself, better than
its present. So the tribes that lived in the lowlands
nourished traditions of descent from gods or ancestors
who abode on the mountains, and they inaugurated
pilgrimages to seek inspiration or a golden
age “on high places, far away.” The chosen people
of God thus constantly were allured from the worship
of the Everywhere and One Jehovah by the enthusiasm
of the heathen devotees who flocked to the mountain
fanes. Turn which way one will in the night of the
ages and the spectacle of the pilgrim is before him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Ancient Hinduism, followed by that of to-day, witnessed
annually, pilgrims counted by hundreds
of thousands to the temple of murderous Juggernaut,
the Ganga Sagor, or isle of Sacred Ganges. The
Buddhists journey to Adam’s Peak in Ceylon, and the
Lamaists of Thibet travel adoringly to their Lha-Isa;
the Japanese have their pilgrim shrines amid perilous
approaches at Istje, while the Chinese, who claim to
be sons of the mountains, clamber with naked knees
the rugged sides of Kicou-hou-chan. The pilgrimages
of the Jews occupy many chapters of Holy Writ, for all
their ancient worthies “<i>not having received the promises,
but seeing them afar off ... confessed that they were
pilgrims and strangers</i>.” Christ confronted the pilgrim
spirit perverted in the person of the woman of Samaria,
at the eastern foot of Gerezim. She and her people
rested their hopes in pilgrimages to their supposed
to be sacred places, but the Saviour declared to her by
Jacob’s well, truths, both grand and revolutionary, in
these words: “The hour ... now is when the true
worshiper shall worship the Father in spirit ... not
in this mountain nor in Jerusalem.” “Go call thy husband
and come hither. Whosoever drinketh the water
I shall give shall never thirst.” There were volumes
in the golden sentences and they plainly said no need
to travel far to find the Everywhere God Who ever
comes where men are to satisfy their every thirst. “Go
call thy husband.” Go to thy home and find the water
of life through doing God’s will; it is better to be a
missionary than a pilgrim unless the pilgrim be also
missioner. But the truths of that hour have found
tardy acceptance among many. The children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Jacob are pilgrims throughout the earth, and the disciples
of Christ, since His departure, have gone pilgriming
often, as did their fathers before them. Constantine,
the Roman emperor, and his mother, Helena,
by example and precept, urged Christendom to
re-embark in such pious journeys, and at the end of
the first thousand years of its existence, Christianity
had hosts of disciples actuated by the same old
passion that sent religionists everywhere to seek
shrines, fanes and blessings. Then the belief began
to be held everywhere among Christians that the
millennial period was at hand. Multitudes abandoned
friends, sold or gave away their possessions, and
hastened toward the Holy Land, where they believed
Jesus Christ was to appear to judge the world. Here
two pilgrim tides, utterly opposed to each other, met;
the Christian and the Mohammedan. The followers of
the False Prophet, like other men, were imbued with
the pilgrim spirit. Some of these thought perfection
could be attained only within the precincts of Babylon
or Bagdad, and others sincerely believed that they
could find peculiar nearness to heaven about the stone-walled
Kaaba of Mecca. It was held to be not only a
privilege but a duty, incumbent upon all, to take these
religious journeys; hence men and women, young and
old, undertook them. Even the decrepit were under
the obligation, and they must either undertake the work,
though failure by death were certain, or hire a proxy to
go in their behalf. So was rolled up stupendously the
numbers of pilgrim graves which have marked this earth
of ours. The Christian pilgrims for a time thronged
toward Palestine, first as a small stream, then as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a torrent. Europe at large was aroused, and all impulses
converged toward the Holy Sepulcher. The
soldiers of the Cross soon added swords to their equipments;
the flashing of spears outshone the altar lights,
and almost before they realized it the priests and pious
pilgrims were transformed to mailed knights. There
was a root to the impulse, and that the universally
felt need of ideals, patterns, personages of heroic mold
in all goodness, to show men how to live. The pilgrims
turned their eyes to the worthies of the past, and
soon came to believe that they could best imbibe their
spirit amid their tombs and former abodes. Like
most religionists they grew to believe God their
especial friend, and they therefore soon came to feel
that, against all odds, He would help them to victory.
Then they easily grew to believe that death in their
crusades would merit the martyr’s crown. Their courage
was unbounded, for many went out with a passion
to die in the cause they had embraced. The following
crusades were marked by conflicts between Moslem
and Christian, filled with fanatical and merciless fury,
though both the opposing hosts claimed to be doing
all they did in God’s name and under his especial direction.
“<i>Deus vult</i>,” “God wills it,” was the war-cry
of a mighty army, each of which bore on his banner and
on his breast the sign of the Cross, the emblem eternally
exalted by the Prince of Peace, who willingly died
that others might live; but these soldiers were bent on
slaying those they could not convert. They were in a
transitional state, passing from being pilgrims to being
missionaries, but the course was a bloody one. They
promoted their self-complacency by persuading themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that it was a heaven-offending wrong to continue
to suffer heretics to occupy the places made sacred by
the Saviour when in the world. Then multitudes of
Christian priests taught that the pious needed free course
to visit the holy places of the East, that they might upbuild
their faith and their grasp of theological abstractions
by beholding objects associated with the tenets
they had adopted. The Moslems had no interest in
these proceedings beyond a desire to thwart them.
The Christians, to be sure, had the moral disadvantage
of being invaders, but then censure of them is mitigated
by the fact that Syria was stolen property to the Turk.
The latter held it by the stern title deed of the sword.
The reader of this summary will be chiefly advantaged
by remembering that this conflict was one of
the mightiest efforts in the direction of missionary
work ever attempted by man, and that being attempted
by force it failed utterly. Now the Crusaders were
believers in Christ and devoted to Mary. These
facts awaken questions as to how, since the spirits of
these twain are finally to conquer all hearts, their
champions were so defeated? The Crusaders desired to
promote the glory of the Man of men and the woman
of women, but sought it by aims only weakly worthy,
and means often atrocious. It never matters to Christ’s
kingdom who possesses His grave if He only possesses
all hearts. The Crusaders, beginning with a warm
sentiment of respect for the Virgin, suffered their
sentimentality to run mad, and mad sentiment is ripe
for folly and defilement. An opal, they say, will
change its color when its wearer is sick; so a man
wearing a priceless virtue on the sleeve of his creed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
will find its luster bedimmed when evil sickens his
heart. The Crusaders had grand banners, mottoes, war-cries
and ideals, but they did not know how to honestly
and truly apply them. Their efforts and results
well serve to emphasize the truth that moral advances
are made with grander forces than those of the
sword; that in the end the heroes and heroines of the
world’s regeneration will appear potent and regnant
solely in the sweetness, truth and exaltation of personal
character. Crusader and Moslem, at heart, were
each desirous of making the world better, but they each,
in fact for a time made it fearfully worse. Probably
the followers of the Cross and the followers of the
Crescent would have been glad to have bestowed all
kindness each on the other, if only the one would have
accepted the creed of the other. But the humanity
and charity of each were as to the other eclipsed
utterly by a zeal for theories. There was need to both
that there arise a harmonizing ideal. It would seem
as if Providence suffered these opposing pilgrims to
peel each other until each in sheer disgust was driven
to seek some better way. An able historian affirms
that the Crusades did not “change the fate of a single
dynasty, nor the boundaries and relative strength of a
nation”—but they did leave a history, the contemplation
of which affords rare thought-food. The conflict
ended in the utter route and flight of the Christians.
The tragedy ended at Acre, but there were left some
things that took shape in men’s thinking, and the world
was made thereby better. The populations and properties
of Christian Europe had been squandered to a
startling degree in these religious wars, and it was fitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that there be some return to compensate. The result
of all others, that grew out of the Crusades, and was
indeed also a leading cause of their vigor, was the rising
of the spirit of chivalry. The dawn of chivalry first begat
brave fighting, but in time the chivalrous discovered
a theater for their activity amid the amenities of peace.
Chivalry was a rebound from the rugged, barbarous belief
of the semi-civilized, whose trust was in brute force
and whose constant <i>dictum</i> was, “Might makes right.”
Men became impressed with a spirit of tenderness, and,
little by little the duty and beauty of the strong’s helping
the weak dawned upon humanity. To be chivalrous,
by the unwritten laws of custom, became the obligation
of every man who sought popular respect. Chivalry was
in the creed of the noble and brave, and men delighted
to become the companions of lone pilgrims, patrons of
beggars, protectors of children and defenders of women.
Toward the gentler sex, the spirit of chivalry finely
expressed itself by not only defending helpless females
amid physical perils, but by according to womankind
distinguished courtesy, refined politeness, and
all those proper respects that so appropriately garnish
and ornament the social intercourse of the sexes in properly
cultivated societies. Before the advent of this
chivalric time, women had been deemed as generally
every way inferior to men; chiefly desirable as ministers
to the necessities or appetites of their lords; useful
as mothers, but worthy of very little respect, confidence
or lasting admiration. The dawn of this new
and fine gallantry was a step toward woman’s disinthrallment.
Chivalry tried to express itself in the
Crusades; defeated, its ardor still burned, and Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
felt its beneficent glow long after the conflict for Syrian
sepulchers had ceased. And here it is of the utmost
importance that the reader forget not the key fact,
that before the advent of the attractive spirit of chivalry,
men’s minds in Christian communities were profoundly
penetrated and wondrously incited by a deep
and new regard for the <i>Queenly woman Mary, the
mother of Jesus</i>! She had been almost rediscovered.
By a common consent, Christian pulpits had begun
sounding her praises, as the ideal woman; a woman
worthy of the veneration and emulation of all. The
various religious communities vied with each other in
doing her honor. The Cistercians declared her purity
by wearing white, the Servi wore black to commemorate
her touching sorrows, and other bodies elected as
their distinguishing badges, various garbs or signs
solely to proclaim their allegiance to their ideal
woman. A popular moral coronation of Mary resulted.
The Crusaders outran all others in their adulation of,
and committal to, the wondrous woman. They were
the first to call her “Our Lady.” She was <span class="smcap">the</span> Lady
of the hearts of all. These chivalrous soldiers to her
spoke their pious vows, from her besought holy favors,
and in her name, with sacred oaths, committed their
all to effort to wrest all Palestine from the enemies of
Mary’s Son.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now these millions of men were not
mad, nor in pursuit of a phantom. It was all very real
to them. They desired to express a long pent-up natural
feeling, and they found an object all satisfactory
in Mary. The Crusaders returned finally and for
good from battling with Moslem; they returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
thoroughly, disastrously defeated: but with their
love for Mary all aglow. When they first called her
“Our Lady,” there may have been an admixture of
irreverence and dilettante in the thought of many;
they were purged of these in the hurricane of battle
and in the terrors of that inhospitable land of their
pilgrimages. Amid trials, far away from his home,
often in severe want, frequently confronting slavery
and death, the Christian knight while adding “<i>Ave
Marie</i>” to his “<i>Patre Nostre</i>,” learned to think of the
Madonna as his mother. Missing the latter keenly,
worshiping the other unfeignedly, woman took a high
throne in his esteem. Sword conquest began to seem
to the war-wearied soldier very insignificant as compared
to a ministry of comfort, peace and good will.
The defeated Crusaders returned to scatter through all
Europe a new gospel of humanity. They exalted the
Queen of David’s line and forgot to recount the fortunes
of war in the East in expounding the dawning
beauties of the woman that entranced them and the
queenship this ideal had gained over their minds. So
they prepared multitudes of the sterner sex for a lasting
belief in the worthfulness of true womanhood at
its best. The Christian world was ripe for such a
revival, when the priests began to thunder “On to
Jerusalem!” but men needed not so much war as
conversion; not so much relics and tombs as loving
principles exemplified. It is wonderful how conversion
womanizes some men. That is a triumph of the
spiritual over the sensual, the beautiful over the gross.
It will make a man of brutal, selfish fiber, in time, as
tender as a mother toward her child and as self-denying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as a maid toward her lover. The Crusaders started
out to rescue the tomb of the dead Saviour from unbelievers
and failed, but they returned to herald the
renaissance of Mary, the disenslaving of woman;
to call the state, the home and individuals to all the
refinements which the exaltation of such an ideal of
necessity offered. Toward this advening the rising
spirit of chivalry was bending the finest hearts when
the clarions of war, sounded from altar and baptistry,
summoned all to raise the red banner against the
Moslem. Right here it is worthy of notice that God’s
providence presented other, though allied, principles in
the conflict against the Orientals. Two pilgrim hosts,
thinking to choose their own ways, were wisely led to
better goals than they knew. The Turk presented the
throng of the harem as his family; the Christian was
committed to the union of only two in holy wedlock.
One party presented a banner with a Cross, forever the
emblem of self-sacrifice; the other the Crescent,
emblem of youthfulness increasing, a hint ever of the
hope of endless lust, whether borne of the master of a
harem or by the heathen follower of the ancient moon-horned
Astarte. The last at Acre, by the Syrian border
of the Mediterranean Sea, the Saracen hugged
victory and the Cross-bearers were utterly routed. So
reads human history, but in truth the defeat was only
apparent and local. The followers of the Crescent,
holding the creed of lust and making pleasure of sense
their end came surely toward their destruction when successes
encouraged them in their courses; the followers
of the Cross, on the other hand, had within some
germs of truth, life-giving in themselves and too beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to be suffered to die from the earth. Trial and defeat
watered these germs and the knightly hosts returned
to Europe by thousands to proclaim finer doctrines
than those by which the priest had incited them to
war. The returning soldiers were transformed from
pilgrims to missionaries, from being taught to teaching,
from restorers of Palestine’s graves to restorers of
European society. Of the “Teutonic Knights of Saint
Mary,” a fine and representative order, an impartial
historian writes: “They defended Christianity against
the barbarians of Eastern Europe.” “After many
bloody encounters introduced German manners, language
and morals.” Of the Knighthood, as a whole,
says another, “the institution that could breed such
characters as these, obviously rendered an enduring service
to humanity. Its spirit lives on, offering examples
which the young still welcome in their joyous, dreamy
days. The ideal still remains, purified by time, freed
from its frailties, and aids in fashioning modern sentiment
to the conception and admiration of the Christian
gentleman.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">As a traveler climbs the mountain to see the
sunrise, so he that would overlook the past
or present must needs clamber to some
lofty point of vision in a significant era or
historic location. There are two plains in Syria; one
lying along the Mediterranean, the other jutting out
from the base of the former toward Jordan; the two
together, in shape very like a sickle, have witnessed
events wonderfully instructive and determinate to the
student of the philosophy of time’s course. These
two plains are known respectively as Esdrælon and
Acre. The sea and the mountains give these plains
their sickle shape, and the geographical outlines are
constantly suggestively before the mind as one remembers
these plateaus not only as the highways but the
battle-fields of the ancient nations. For while, as one
says, “the face of nature smiles”—“no spot on earth
more fertile,” he also says “no field on earth was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
fattened by the blood of the slain.” There the Philistines,
the Ptolemys, Antiochus, the Maccabees, Herod,
Baldwin, King of Jerusalem, Salah-ed-din, Cœur-de-Lion,
Melek-Seruf and Napoleon, each in turn, put
their ambitions and their beliefs to the stern arbitrament
of swords. There the kingdom of the House of
David struggled for life; there the splendid dream of
the Crusaders ended as a nightmare.</p>

<p>As a jewel in the haft of the sickle, at the northerly
end of the plain by the sea, sits the city of Acre. This
city compels the attention of the preacher and student
of history and gives theme to him who blends symbol
into song. Acre gave its name to its adjacent country
round about, and though both city and plain witnessed
many a change of master in the past, those changing
masters, to gratify their whims or strengthen their
policies from time to time, giving the places various
names. The Knights of Saint John made it their elect
city, honoring it as Saint Jean de Acre, the martyr maid
of France. From the city itself one may look out over
the sea-highway of nations; from the drear and lofty
mountains of its surrounding country one may look
over many memorable places. Acre was often called
the “Key of Palestine” by the soldier strategists and
by the chroniclers of events. To their testimony is
added that of the inspired writers and prophets who
made it their key and mountain of outlook frequently.</p>

<p>These plains, dotted all about by sacred places,
memorable for two great victories; Barak over the
Canaanites and Gideon over the Midianites; and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
great disasters, the death of Saul and the death of
Josiah, became to the Jews the symbol of the conflict
of right and wrong. Prophetically, and in the serene
hope that righteousness at last would prevail, the plain
was called Armageddon, “the Mountain of the Gospel.”
We hear the rapt Zechariah thus descanting:
“The Lord also shall save the glory of the house of
David and the house of David shall be as God.” “And
it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications;
and they shall look upon me whom they
have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one
mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for
him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.”</p>

<p>The prophet looked forth to the Pentecostal day of
salvation and the assured victories of David’s great
successor. Following this ancient seer, John the beloved,
in the Visions of the Apocalypse repeats, these
oracles. During the wars of the Crusaders, Acre was
sometimes in their possession and sometimes held by
their Turkish foes. In the year 1191 Richard the Lion
Heart wrested it from the infidel leader Salah-ed-din.
The Christians held it firmly until 1291, the time when
the last wave of the Crusader advance ebbed, in bloody
defeat, from the shores of the Holy Land. For two
hundred years the believer of the West and the Moslem
grappled with each other in deadly conflict; war’s fortunes
often changing, but the awful price in human
misery and human blood was inexorably exacted at
every stage of the conflict. Acre was the focus toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which the eddying tides ever and anon moved; therefore
it saw not only the end but the worst of the Crusades.</p>

<p>Our story begins A. D. 1291 at Acre, the Key of Palestine,
in Armageddon, “the mountain of the Gospel.”
The situation may be briefly depicted: Acre was filled
with a mixed and un-homogeneous population. There
were the ubiquitous Galilean traders, without politics;
shrewd to the last degree in traffic and courtly as a
Parisian; there some secret, sullen, silent enemies of
the Christian invaders, awaiting the coming end; there
hundreds of those camp-following nondescript “good
lord and good devil” characters, and there the remnants
of the Crusader armies. The latter were not
only diminished as to numbers but greatly degraded in
moral tone. Their warfare had been belittled to a defense
and a retreat. The adventurers were uppermost;
courts-martial, intrigues and fanfaronade were their occupation
daily. Prince Edward, the Christian leader,
had made a sworn treaty with the Moslems long before
this time; but his pious followers had quickly, wickedly
violated it. Thereupon the Sultan, Kha-tel, had made
an irrevocable treaty with himself, sealed with the most
awful oath he could register, that he would never tire
until he had exterminated the last of the Western
invaders now circumscribed and besieged in Acre.
With 200,000 dusky followers the Sultan besieged the
last stronghold of the Crusaders. The hearts of the
defenders sank within them, and scores sought safety
in homeward flight, loading down every vessel bound
for Europe. Among the first fugitives was the chief
leader, Hugh de Lusignan, who wore the phantom title,
“King of Jerusalem.” He preferred the safety of distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Cyprus to the doubtful regality which was overshadowed
with nearing death. Only 12,000 were left
to represent the Crusade cause which once mustered
millions. May 18, 1291, the devoted city was stormed
by the Turks; an entrance was effected and a murderous
carnage, heaping the streets with the dead, and redding
the foam of the moaning sea, followed. But there
was no easy victory to the Moslem, for the steady, vigorous,
brilliant, desperate fighting of the knights, laying
low piles of their foes for every one of themselves
that fell, compelled the respect of the Sultan’s host.
The Turks attempted to gain a surrender by offering
bribes; these failing, terms were offered. The latter,
which included permission for the Crusade remnant to
depart the country in peace, were accepted. But the
Sultan, taught, if he needed the lesson, by the perfidy
of Prince Edward’s Christian truce-breakers, quickly
broke his promise of safe conduct. Though the retreating
band was in no way party to the wrong he
sought to avenge, they were mercilessly ambuscaded.
There followed another struggle to the death, a handful
against a host and but few succeeded in cutting
their way through the cordon of death. History has
often recounted the preceding events up to the point;
from this point it is proposed to lead the reader along
the career of a fragment tossed out of the foregoing
whirlpool of disaster.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The course of the knights fleeing from Acre
was turned toward Nazareth. There being
but one way open to them, they took that
way quickly and with one accord. The
fugitives from Acre represented various knightly
orders, but they were disorganized, without any definite
destination and without an authorized leader. Among
them was Sir Charleroy de Griffin, a knight famed for
valor, a central and commanding personage; one that
would have attracted attention in almost any assembly
of men. As he went, so went the rest of the fleeing
Christians, and when he reined in his panting steed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after a time, at the top of a fir-crested knoll not far
from Nazareth, the knights following him did likewise.
Then they drew around him in a semi-circle, without
command, and simultaneously, as if to solicit his
direction. They had followed the course he took
because he took it, and now with one accord they
halted because he had done so. There is to some a
subtile influence that makes them leaders of men; so
the disorganized Crusaders, by an unvoiced but fully
expressed concession, admitted the leadership of this
dashing horseman. Some may designate this a
triumph of personal magnetism, but be that as it may,
it was a fact that Sir Charleroy was chief. Sir Charleroy,
just at the time of the foregoing incident, presented
an admirable study for the philosopher or
painter. From his saddle he was able to overlook
leagues of bright landscape, but he could not claim the
protection of a foot of it; for the first time in his life
he yearned for home, now a spreading sea, and a wall
of death shut it out from him apparently for ever; by
circumstances absolute sovereign almost of the men
about him, but doubt and danger were confounding all
his ability to give commands. He fell into a train of
thought, leaving his comrades to converse with their
pawing steeds and to questionings within themselves
as to the future. Sir Charleroy had reached an
eminence in life, one of those points of out-look where
a man’s past meets him and demands review, that it
may explain the present. He believed that he had
reached very nearly the end of his career, and in that
belief he began to weigh it for what it was worth.
In imagination he saw one writing the story of his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Sir Charleroy, the refugee, began faithfully to review
Sir Charleroy, the wayward youth, pleasure-seeker and
reckless man. The former dictated mentally to the
imaginary scribe: “Write, Charleroy de Griffin was
the son of a stalwart French Baron, used to duels and
trained to war. The boy inherited from his father a
splendid physique, of which he was unduly proud, and
a restless disposition that he never sincerely asked God
to control. By the death of the baron, his son, an
infant, was left to the sole tutelage of his English
mother. The latter was of high birth, by nature a
noble woman, and in every way worthy of a better son
than the one whom he had turned out to be. She had
idolized her brawny spouse in his lifetime, and when
she had recovered from the shock his death caused, her
yearning heart, little by little, turned from the idol in
the tomb to the child he had left her. Ere long she
lived again in the rapture of a love all absorbing, all
bestowing, all ruling. She lavished her affection on
the youth, not because he was particularly lovable, for
he was not, but because he was the only one left her
to love, and she was so constituted that she must love;
the necessity of loving to her made it easy.</p>

<p>“Then there were many things in the features and
form of her son that reminded her of the man who, in
brighter days, had won entirely her maiden heart and
her young wife love. The child was wont to wonder
why his mother embraced him as she did sometimes,
with a wondering, startled, wild, passionate embrace;
but when he got older he discerned the meaning of
these outbreaks. He knew that the mother-heart was
having a vision of past wifehood, memory’s grace-given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
solace of widowhood. Besides this the embraces were
her appealings or warnings to death; her heart suddenly
seizing as if to shelter and save her last and only
idol; for the thought would sometimes come with
shadows deep enough, that perhaps the boy might
also die. Such love would have been a prized wealth
and blessing to some; but in this case, on the one hand,
it unfitted this mother for the proper disciplining of this
son, and this son though, sometimes, when his conceit
permitted it, realizing that the love was given, not won,
began to expect it as his due or despise it for its lavishness.
In due time he entered the period expressively
designated, ‘The monster age.’ This is the time
when expanding young life has outgrown the tenderness
of infancy and failed of putting on manly and
womanly graces; a time when there is a mighty ambition
to put on the characteristics of adult life and a
mighty lack of ability gracefully to wear them. At this
period, perhaps, the majority of youths of both sexes,
are interesting chiefly for what they have been, or what
it is hoped they will be. They feel, conscious of their
growing powers, great self-conceit, and with their
growth comes an expansion of their capacities and wants.
The plenitude of their wantings makes them avaricious,
hence parsimonious toward others of every thing, especially
of gratitude. Reverence for elders, respect for
fathers, holy regard for mothers, tenderness toward
women, chief charms of youth, are buried in the tomb of
other virtues by great, selfish, ugly demons of desire.
The monster age came to Charleroy in its full virulence,
but his mother discerned little of his monstrosity;
what she did discern, all unasked, she condoned. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
believed all things, hoped all things good of him,
although seldom comforted by an expression or act of
gratitude on his part. She was to be pitied; but it
may be said that the lad was to be pitied almost as
much as herself. It was the old story over; she unconsciously
went about destroying her own happiness and
though she would have willingly died if need be in his
behalf, she harmed him beyond estimate by her indulgent
loving. Then the youth was surrounded by those
who sought the favor of the baroness by constantly
sounding in her ears, and in the ears of the boy, praises
of the dead baron. They told of his daring, they descanted
upon his adventures, his powers, his wisdom.
He was the widow’s idol, and the incense was grateful
to her, but the worst of it was that they befooled the
lad by continually assuring him that he was the image
of his father, and surely destined to equal, if not surpass,
his sire in deeds of valor. A dangerous burden is
wealth; whether it come as great name or great intellect,
great physical strength or as much gold, it is a
fateful load which few can gracefully support. The
youth had wealth in all the foregoing directions; if he
had had a mother whose love loved wisely enough to
save, if it need be by pain, he might have been saved;
but her love infatuated her. The youth’s folly brought
him frequently into shameful entanglements; but she
extricated him each time. Nobody ever heard of her
even rebuking him; as to chastising him, that were a
thing abhorrent to her thoughts. His face always
bespoke his pardon in advance with her. She would
have smitten her husband’s corpse, as it lay in its
coffin, as soon as she would have smitten the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
whose features constantly reminded her of him her
heart had held most dear. Then she hoped, with a
mother’s large-hearted faith, that each escapade would
be the last. But as the youth grew older his acts were
bolder. Again and again, without notice and with
heartless inconsiderateness, he left his home to pursue
some adventure, and again and again, mother’s love
followed him, ever to find him at last in some sore
plight, and then quickly to forgive him. By the time
Charleroy had reached his majority, the family fortune
had been severely tried and depleted in paying the
penalty of his follies. He himself had become an old
young man, with too many gray hairs and too much
experience for one of his years.</p>

<p>“At that time, a few enthusiasts having determined
to make one last effort to secure the Holy Sepulcher,
Charleroy de Griffin ardently enlisted in the pre-doomed
enterprise, allured largely by its very desperateness.
The crusade spirit was then a fitful dying
flame throughout Europe. England and France were
left practically alone to furnish the men and the money
for the last crusade. Prince Edward of France was its
leader, and De Griffin, having in his veins the blood of
both of the supporting nations, a French name, a
splendid physique, together with a fearless, dashing
temperament, was enthusiastically hailed to the enlistment
and pushed forward to leadership. ‘<i>Sir</i> Charleroy
de Griffin!’ smilingly called out Prince Edward,
the day of review, before the one set for departure.
The young man’s comrades, many of whom had been
his associates in former days of wassail, hearing the
Prince’s word, shouted out with one accord, ‘Knighted!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
The prince has knighted de Griffin! Hurrah for Sir
Charleroy!’ The day following Sir Charleroy bowed
his head, as he stood on the quay ready to embark, to
receive the benediction of a bishop. As the sacrist
laid his hands on the young man’s head, the latter,
throwing back his cloak, reverently touched the cross
he had attached to his bosom with his jeweled sword-hilt.
The young knight for a little while was very
complacent; for he was enjoying a sentimental emotion
of virtue, arising from sophistries with which his
mind toyed. Some way he felt he had become a soldier
of the holy Christ, and somehow it seemed to
him he was making atonement for past follies by now
placing himself side by side with the pious and
noble. Though in reality only bent on seeking excitement,
adventure, change, he looked forward to the rewards
of conscience belonging alone to the penitent,
and to a possible public canonizing as one going forth
to die for God. A little piety paralleling one’s own
desires is often made to do great service in silencing
the clamors from within. His proud, tearful mother
was by his side. Passionately she kissed his cross,
then his brow, then his eyes and then his lips; leaving
on the brow the glistening, dewy jewels that told the
story of the heart which bade him stay, yet go. The
young knight was for once in his life very serious, but
tearless. After all this, in rapid steps, followed the
disaster at Acre; the desperate struggle outside the
city; the flight toward Nazareth. Sir Charleroy finally
stands between the sea and the city, a mother’s idol
ready to be broken; at twenty-five, near the apparent
apex and end of a life, having had great opportunities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
now, with all lost, he stands there an epitome of paradoxes.
He had made life a pursuit of pleasure only
to find the pursuit ending in misery; he had enlisted
to serve the Prince of Peace, but that service he had
undertaken with the sword; he had championed, as he
said, the cause of Christ, the all-conquering, but he
meets utter defeat. He had taken for his patron saint
Mary, after years of libertinism. He elected Mary, he
said, because his mother was so like her. But Sir
Charleroy’s mother demoralized her son by over-indulgence,
while Mary, though informed by Gabriel
that her offspring was divine, followed her child as a
true mother, with the divinely appointed authority of
a mother, serenely, constantly directing his career up
to the feast of Jerusalem, where he began to reveal his
divine commission. Even then, motherhood affirmed
its rights in the very presence of God manifest, in the
question: ‘<i>Son, why hast thou dealt thus?</i>’ Nor was the
right challenged, for ‘<i>he went down and was subject to</i>’
father and mother!” At this point Sir Charleroy ceased
mentally tracing his own career, and lifting his eyes
looked intently toward Nazareth. “Ah,” he said, but
so that none could hear his words, “my mother loved
as many another, in part selfishly, for the joy of
abandoned love, and I squander that patrimony like a
spendthrift, to my harm. Mary’s love for her son
was like his for the world, a constant self-abnegation.
That love survives as an inspiration to the world. By
these contrasts I explain my failure in life, and the
present is the natural sequence of the past.”</p>

<p>“I walked along the top of the hills overlooking Nazareth. A
glorious scene opened on the view. The air was perfectly serene
and clear. I remained for some hours lost in contemplation of the
wide prospect and the events connected with the scene. One of
the most beautiful and sublime prospects on earth.”—<span class="smcap">Robinson’s</span>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The avenging Turks easily persuaded themselves
that they could serve God better by
participating in the sacking of fallen Acre
than by pursuing the conquered, fleeing
Christian knights; so they let the latter escape
inland, while they themselves returned to the pillage.
Ere long, by stealth, good fortune and Providential
leading, the fugitives arrived unmolested at
the top of a hill, overlooking the little city of
Nazareth, forever memorable as having been once the
earthly abiding place of Jesus and Mary. On the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
thither scarcely a sentence had been spoken, for each
felt that murmuring would be harmful, mirth inopportune.
They chose their course indifferently, all following
Sir Charleroy de Griffin because he rode bravely
and onward. The fugitives paused, partly sequestered
by the shrubbed hillock, forgetting for a time all else in
admiration of the outspreading panorama in view.
Heaven and earth were smiling at each other; thousands
of leagues of sky were filled with the raptured
songs of larks, while as echo and challenge of the
songs from above, the thrush and robin of the grass
knoll and thicket responded. From the plains of
El Battaf on the north to Esdrælon on the south
Nature, God’s flower queen, had decked the earth everywhere
with blossoms of pinks, tulips and marigolds.</p>

<p>“Those dusky cowards,” spoke Sir Charleroy,
“though numbering ten to one, will not seek us here;
they’ll wait an opportunity to ambuscade us.”</p>

<p>“We’ve broken our knight’s pledge, never to flee
more than the distance of four French acres from
a foe, and yet methinks we’ve made them respect
our swords; that’s something to say, though we’ve
not made them respect our creed.” It was a Knight
of the Golden Cross that spoke.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy continued, while his eyes turned
toward the city: “I thirst for the waters of a fount
in Nazareth as did David once for one in Bethlehem.”</p>

<p>“For all of our getting at it, Nazareth’s water might
as well be in Ethiopia,” spoke a Hospitaler.</p>

<p>“I’ve a yearning that comes near to sending me on
a charge into the city.”</p>

<p>“That would be a hot pursuit of death surely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“A fair one, then, since death has been long
pursuing us.” After a moment’s pause Sir Charleroy
continued:</p>

<p>“Ah, death! None can escape, none overtake him;
see we are his prisoners now, yet he tantalizes us by a
show of immunity. As a sarcophagus is let down by
suspending ropes in tedious stages, with jogglings and
pauses, into the grave, so passes each through perils and
sickenings from life to death. No, no, an undue fear
of death intoxicates us until phantasmagoria possess
the brain. We call these hopes; they are delusive!
But will any of you follow for a charge down to the
Virgin’s fountain? We can not more than die; that
we must soon, in any event. I think I could die more
complacently, having cooled my thirst where she was
wont to cool hers.”</p>

<p>“Ugh,” exclaimed the Templar, with a shudder of
disgust, “the fountain flows out through an old stone
coffin! By my plume! while drinking there I’d be
fancying that the ghost of the one robbed of his last
house were leering at me and reveling in the thought
that I’d soon be poor and thirstless as he. Verily
the flavor of a drink depends much on the goblet!”</p>

<p>“We may have plenty of miserable fancies, if we
only court such; for me, Templar, I prefer to comfort
myself by cheerier thoughts; while I drank there, I’d
think of the coolings of death’s streams; of her, that
at this fountain slaked her body’s thirst and from the
chalice of death drank serenely at last. My sword,
the gift of my king, after having shed torrents of
blood, hangs uselessly at my side. It seems cruel as
powerless; ay, ’tis hateful! My mother gave me, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
my departure, better gifts by far; tears, kisses, undying
love, and the charge to call on Mary if ever evil
befell me. The latter I know not how to do; but
still my weak faith, methinks, would be helped to
cry ‘Mother’ to God, if I could only stand where
that mother stood who won the first love of the
infant Jesus, the last anxious thoughts of the God
man.”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy is unusually pious to-night; but
alas, though I’ve been taught to say our church’s
<i>Litany</i>, calling on ‘the Virgin most faithful,’ ‘Virgin
most merciful,’ ‘Help of the Christian,’ ‘Lady of
Victories,’ I can not use those phrases here. Where’s
the help, the mercy, the victory now? The <i>Litany</i>,
belongs to England!”</p>

<p>“We are in our present plight because we have
won heaven’s neglect through having more vices than
graces, probably.”</p>

<p>“Whatever the cause, the mocking disappointment
is apparent. It is nigh thirteen hundred years since
the Holy son and His mother began proclaiming and
exemplifying the White Kingdom here. Now in all
this land of theirs, we thirteen, fateful number, alone
are left of those who openly own His cause. Yea, and
the city where He grew in favor, these nature-blessed
plains whose flowers gave Him picture sermons, are
all filled with burrowing monsters eternally at war
with Him and His.”</p>

<p>“Faith will rest until assured that the Promiser is
dead, and that can never be, Sir Knight.”</p>

<p>“My faith staggers at the sights of Nazareth. Chief,
look yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The knights all now called Sir Charleroy chief, when
addressing him.</p>

<p>“At what?”</p>

<p>“The ruins!”</p>

<p>“Ah, all that’s left of our Crusader church. They
say it was built on the very spot where Mary fell
fainting, when she saw the Nazarenes in wrath dragging
her son away to cast him down from the precipice
to death. But He escaped, though the church since
built did not!”</p>

<p>“True; therefore it seems to me that the hand
on time’s dial turns backward. This city is filled
with creatures having hearts as hard as the limestone
walls of the cave-like houses they fittingly
inhabit. If Christ and His Mother were again on
earth as before, mercy’s ministers, the present inhabitants
of Nazareth would surpass His ancient persecutors
in the zeal with which they would drag not only
Him but His mother to the cliffs.”</p>

<p>“Over the door of yon ruined church, some hand
of faith carved the word ‘Victory!’ The word is there
yet, and though the hand that carved it is dead, the
faith which prompted it hath victory assured it.”</p>

<p>“‘Victory,’ in ruins! A meaningless boast, as it
seems to me, Sir Charleroy. Such victory as ours;
shadowy and very distant!”</p>

<p>At that moment one of the Templars, who had been
secretly praying behind a cactus hedge, drew near and
the Hospitaler addressed him:</p>

<p>“Brother, any token?”</p>

<p>“Praise Jehovah! yes, of peace.”</p>

<p>“How came it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“In my communings, God brought to my mind how
the wondrous Deborah, not far from here, pushed the
pusillanimous Barak from his refuge among the pistacas
and oaks, from waverings to courage and to glorious
victory over God’s foes.”</p>

<p>“A happy thought; ‘the stars on their course fought
against Sisera!’”</p>

<p>“Barak was called the ‘thunderbolt,’ but Deborah
was the ‘lightning.’ The lightning gave force to the
bolt and God to the lightning.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy, catching the last sentence, joined in
the debate:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, there is another lesson on the brow of
that history; it is, that women, having more trust,
cleave closer to God in peril than do men. Men are
in a panic when their devices fail; women have fewer
devices to fail, hence are less easily confounded. For
that reason God sent out our race in pairs.”</p>

<p>“Hermon’s breast holds the last ray of the setting
sun,” remarked the Golden Cross.</p>

<p>“And the Transfiguration of Christ is recalled! I
think some angel of God is holding the sunlight there
for our instruction, now,” exclaimed the chief.</p>

<p>“Our instruction?” queried the Templar. “I do
not discern its meaning; campaigning I fear has
dulled my brain.”</p>

<p>“The Son of Mary, on yon mount, met Elijah, representative
of the prophets, Moses, representative of the
law; both called from the deathless land to proclaim
the fulfillment of all prophecy and law through His
coming passion.”</p>

<p>“And still I question how this applies to us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“A Knight of the <i>Red Cross</i> should easily discern
that suffering unto death for truth’s sake is the way,
all prophecy declares that a reign of law transforming
things to spiritual splendor shall at last come to earth.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sir Charleroy, the interpretation is entrancing,
but why did the glory need to fade into night, and to
be followed by Gethsemane and Calvary?”</p>

<p>“Life is but a series of temporary glimpses of the
glory that shall be revealed. Night and cloud come
and go, yet the sun never dies.”</p>

<p>“But, Sir Charleroy, was it not hard that the loving
Immanuel should be forced to bide these pangs though
ever pursuing true righteousness?”</p>

<p>“Yea, Templar, but the glory of the Transfiguration
came to all that group while Jesus prayed; as the
angel hastened to minister when Gethsemane was
darkest. These things teach that heaven watches its
own, with succor according to want; great light at
hand to baffle great darkness and royal answers for
anxious prayers!”</p>

<p>“You mean, Sir Charleroy, that we few, surrounded
by a sea of enemies, in an inhospitable land, far from
home, should despise each despairing thought?”</p>

<p>“Good Templar, I am certain of this, anyway:
Suffering for the right has full reward, for after passion
as Christ’s, so to His followers there comes the
ascension.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” fervently ejaculated several surrounding
knights, and Sir Charleroy felt the glow that he felt
that time the English bishop blessed him.</p>

<p>As they thus communed, the sun had quietly sunk
down into the far-off Mediterranean, flooding the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with light like molten gold. Doubtless one thought
came to each at the sight; for all smiled sadly when
one remarked: “The <i>West</i> is very beautiful to-night!”
They thought with deep yearnings of home. But the
darkness quickly drew over the scene and the song of
the baleful nightingales began to start forth here and
there from thickets which, in the darkness, appeared
like plumes of mourning on acres of black velvet.
One knight, for a while entranced by the grim, gloomy
spectacle, shuddered; then looked up as if to say:
“When will the moon rise? the darkness is oppressive!”
Another tried to cheer his comrades by crying:
“England’s songsters know us and come to sing
us into hopefulness!”</p>

<p>“Men, to rest; you’ll need it.” It was Sir Charleroy
who spoke. Responsibility made him motherly.</p>

<p>“Let us revel awhile in memories of better days,”
replied the Templar.</p>

<p>“But listen; do you not hear afar off something
like the moaning of the winds before a storm?”</p>

<p>“What of it? A storm could add little to our
misery.”</p>

<p>“The sound you hear is the cry of jackal and wolf;
our omens. Forget now all unnerving thoughts of
home and steel yourselves to meet hard fortune.
For a while rest. Rest is now our wisdom; night,
our mother; for a time in safety she will swaddle us
within her black garments. And then——”</p>

<p>“Even so, good Sir Charleroy, and I’m thinking
this is her last visit to us. She has come, I
guess, to lead us to the portals of eternal day.”</p>

<p>“When I say good-night to you, comrades, it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with the expectation of next saying good-morning
where the wicked cease from troubling,” solemnly said
the Golden Cross.</p>

<p>“But,” interrupted the Hospitaler, “while the pulse
beats we have a mortgage on time and a duty to plan
to live.”</p>

<p>“Bravely said; now tell us how to plan,” exclaimed
several knights.</p>

<p>“Merge all our orders into one, for the present; elect
a leader, and——” The Hospitaler paused, for he
could not guess the needs or course of the future.
But the knights quickly acquiesced in the unity of
action proposed.</p>

<p>“Who shall lead?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“I nominate,” shouted the Hospitaler, “the one
whom we all believe must be under the especial care
of the good angels of these places sacred to all revering
mother Mary.”</p>

<p>The knights, with one voice, responded, “Sir Charleroy
de Griffin, Teutonic Knight of the Order of St.
Mary!”</p>

<p>The little band dared their danger for a moment by
a spontaneous cheer.</p>

<p>“We have no priest to anoint the chief of the
Refugees, but with God to witness, let each who would
ratify the choice place hilt to shield, as an oath of
service and defense.”</p>

<p>Every hilt rang against Sir Charleroy’s shield, as the
Hospitaler ceased speaking.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” said Sir Charleroy, “I thank you for
your confidence in this hour when the issue is life or
death. Let us seek the God of battles.” The knights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
formed a hollow square about their leader, and all
kneeled upon the earth.</p>

<p>Their wondering steeds seemed to catch the spirit
of their riders, and, drawing near, drooped their heads.
For a few moments there was awing silence, and then
in deep measured tones the Hospitaler began chanting,
“<i>Kyrie Eleison</i>” (Lord have mercy). The companions
responded, “<i>Christi Eleison</i>.” Then, amid those
scenes of sacred history, the kneeling soldiers, together,
and without command, with only the stars for altar-lights,
solemnly chanted a portion of the sublime
Litany of their church. Galilee never before, nor since,
heard a more sincere orison: “Pour forth, we beseech
Thee, oh, Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that we to
whom the incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made
known by the message of an angel, may by His passion
and His cross be brought to the glory of His resurrection,
through the same Christ, our Lord. Amen.”</p>

<p>As they arose, a Templar spoke: “Companions, if it
so please you, put a seal, the seal of the Red Cross
Knights, upon our act.” So saying, the knight crossed
his feet, then spread out his arms horizontally; similitude
of the crucifixion. All reverently imitated the
action, meanwhile, their swords being in hand with
blades crossing, forming a fence of steel.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” spoke Sir Charleroy, with emotion, “I
accept the trust, and vow by Him that gave the single-handed
Elijah on yonder far-off wrinkled Carmel, sign
by fire, that confounded Baal and its regal hosts, to
lead you to liberty and home or to glorious graves.”</p>

<p>“<i>In hoc signo vinces</i>, living or dead,” was the chorused
response. Just then the rising moon flooded their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
interlaced swords with light, and, as they glittered, the
knights took it for an omen that there was a blessing
in the union of their swords.</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy, I proclaim thee king of Jerusalem;
what say you, comrades?” exclaimed a hitherto silent
Knight of St. John. Once more every knight’s sword
touched the leader’s shield.</p>

<p>“Nobly proclaimed!” remarked the Templar.
“When De Lusignan deserted us, ceasing to be kingly,
he ceased to be king.”</p>

<p>“Have charity, men,” interrupted their chief; “it
takes a world of courage to fall with a falling cause
when a way of escape is open.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have charity; the same that Tancred had
for that brave preacher and craven soldier, Hermit
Peter; the latter ran from peril and Tancred raced him
back. We can not reach Lusignan to whip him to duty,
but we can vote him dethroned and dead. All cowards
are dead to the brave.”</p>

<p>“But, companions, I must decline the presumptuous
title and phantom throne. Jerusalem shall have, to
us, but one king; the Son of Mary. For the future, to
you, let me be simply Sir Charleroy. Now let us be
moving.”</p>

<p>“Whither?” anxiously inquired several knights in a
breath.</p>

<p>“Over the valley to the cactus hedges against the
limestone cliffs before us, where runs along the great
highway from Damascus to Egypt. We shall not
need the route to either point, probably; but those
hills are full of caves for the living and tombs for the
dead.” All obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why so thoughtful?” said the Hospitaler to the
Knight of the Golden Cross, who marched along with
his cloak partly shielding his face.</p>

<p>“I’m living in the past,” he sententiously answered.</p>

<p>“The past? Ah, to make up by a back journey for
an expected briefing of thy future?”</p>

<p>“No, raillery here, Hospitaler. I was just wishing
that since we are so near Endor, Saul’s witch would
call up some saintly Samuel to tell us where we shall
be this time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Golden Cross, know we can best bear the good
or evil of the future by seeing it only as it comes;
for me, I prefer to think of another place, near us, but
having a more helpful incident for the memory of such
as we.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou mean Nain?”</p>

<p>“The same. There a dead only son was raised from
the bier to comfort a widowed mother.”</p>

<p>“Well said, Hospitaler,” responded Sir Charleroy,
“and let us not forget that it was a mother’s tearful
prayers that won the working of the miracle.”</p>

<p>“Alas, knight,” sighed the Templar, “we have no
mothers to so petition for us here, if we be quenched
ere long.”</p>

<p>“Some of us have living mothers who never cease to
pray for us, nor will until their breath ceases. In this
land, where God appeared through motherhood, I
have a strong confidence that our mothers’ prayers,
re-enforced by our appealing but unvoiced needs, will
move the motherhood of God, if such I may call His
tenderest lovings. I’ll trust to-night my mother’s
prayers, reaching from England to Heaven and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
thence to here, further than all the sympathy forgetful
Europe will vouchsafe us. A nation cheered us to battle,
and yet it will never seek for the fragments defeat
has left; but the man never lived, no matter what his
ill deserts, whom true mother love and eternal God
love ever forgot.” After this long address, Sir Charleroy
again felt the glow within and the approvings
that he felt on the quay when the bishop’s hands were
on his head.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The fugitives slept, some in the obliviousness
of complete fatigue and others restlessly,
their minds perturbed by dreams of their
impending perils. Dawn summoned all to
renewed activity, but its coming was not greeted joyfully
by the knights.</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy,” mournfully spoke a Hospitaler to
the former, as they met at the outskirts of the camping
place, “our comrade, the Knight of the Holy
Sepulcher, made good his escape from this woeful
country during the early morning, before dawn, as our
comrades were sleeping!”</p>

<p>“Why, impossible!” questioningly responded the
chief.</p>

<p>“Alas, ’twas rather impossible for him not to go!”</p>

<p>“I’m in no humor for such petty jesting! See, his
steed is there yet,” and Sir Charleroy turned on his
heel impatiently as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Pardon, companion, he that departed was borne
away by the white charger with black wings!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“Mortals say ‘dead’ of such, but it were better to
say he is free.”</p>

<p>“<i>Peace to his soul</i>,” fervently spoke Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“Ah, knight, thou canst not imagine the peacefulness
of his going!”</p>

<p>“But why were we not summoned? We might have
consoled him at least; perhaps we might have healed.
What was his malady?”</p>

<p>“A poisoned arrow wounded him in the retreat from
Acre. He did not realize his peril until the agonies of
the end were wracking his body. Then he said, ‘Too
late; it’s useless to attempt resistance of the inevitable.’”</p>

<p>“Now this is pitiful—a humiliation of us all.
Heavens, Hospitaler! there’s not a knight among us
who would not have periled his life in effort in the
dying man’s behalf.”</p>

<p>“But he cautioned me against disturbing any one on
his account. ‘Poor men,’ he said, ‘they’ll need all the
rest they can get for the struggles of the day to come.’
Only once did he seem to yearn for a remedy, and that
time he spoke mostly as one dreaming. I remember
his every word—‘I wish I could bathe these hot and
bleeding wounds in the all-healing nards said to exude
exhaustlessly from the image of the Virgin Most
Merciful at Damascus.’ I roused him, then, with an
appeal for permission to summon thee, but he forbade
me.”</p>

<p>“Thou shouldst have overridden all protests of his!
By my tokens! I’d have emulated faithful Elenora,
who sucked the poison from the dagger stab given her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
spouse, our knightly Prince Edward, by the would-be
assassin at Acre.”</p>

<p>“I could not resist him; his face shone in the moonlight
with heavenly brightness; mine was covered with
tears. Oh, chief, the dying man spoke like an angel.
Once he said: ‘It is sweet to go out here, nigh where
the resurrection angel, Gabriel, gave Mary the glad
tidings that her humanity was to join with the Good
Father to bring forth One capable of sounding each
human sorrow here and hereafter. He overcomes the
dread last enemy of all our race!’ I watched as he
fixed his dying gaze upon the golden cross he wore;
his last words still fill and inflame my soul: ‘Brother,
good-night—say this to each for me. I feel great
darkness creeping in to possess this broken, weary
body. It comes to stay, but my soul moves forth out
of its dungeon. I see gates most lofty, all glorious,
and oh, so near! They open to an eternal day.’ Then
he breathed his last, murmuring tenderly: ‘I’m going;
good-night; good-morning!’” The Hospitaler ended
his recital with a great sob, then burying his face in his
cloak, was silent.</p>

<p>Presently the knights formed a hollow square about
an old tomb in the hillside. The Hospitaler supported
tenderly the head of the dead comrade in his
lap. On the naked breast of the corpse lay the many-pointed
golden cross of the Knights of the Sepulcher,
while round the body was wrapped a Templar’s banner,
with its significant emblem, two riders on one
horse; symbol of friendship and necessity.</p>

<p>“Let the one who received the dying prayer of our
brave companion speak,” said Sir Charleroy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
knights all knelt, and the Hospitaler still reverently
supporting the head of the dead, spoke. “Knight of
Christ, sleep; the clamors of war shall no more disturb
thee. The dead at least are just and merciful.
Israelite, Mohammedan and Christian may lie together
in these vales, reconciled at last. They that would not
share a loaf to save life to one another, in death share
quietly all they have, their beds. The ashes of the
long sleepers have no contentions; here are no
crowdings of each other; no misunderstandings; no
alarms. Sleep, soldier, thy worthy warfare finished;
thy cause appealed to the Judge of All! Sleep and
leave us to battle on ’mid perils and pain. Sleep
thy body, while thy soul fathoms the mysteries to us
inscrutable. Rest now, and leave us here a little
longer to wonder why it is that human creatures must
needs inhumanly oppose and slay each other for the
enthroning of Truth, the friend, the quest of all!
Sleep, and leave us to wonder why death and conflict
are the openers of the gates of life and peace.” Some
of those kneeling wept, but they were too much depressed
to speak. Quietly they laid the body within
its resting place; quietly they sealed up the tomb’s
entrance. Then they mounted their steeds at their
chief’s command.</p>

<p>“There are but twelve of us left; a lucky number.
Perhaps the breaking of the fateful spell believed to
follow the number thirteen, was death’s beneficence!”
It was the Templar who so spoke.</p>

<p>“It is said, Templar,” responded Charleroy, “that
our Mary, in her girlhood, was escorted ever by an invisible
heavenly guard, a thousand strong. In the guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
there were twelve palm-bearing angels of rare splendor,
commissioned to reveal charity.”</p>

<p>“A worthy companionship, chief!”</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to pray heaven to send again to these
parts the beautiful twelve, to assure us good fortune
and victory.”</p>

<p>“Surely the prayers of us all join thine, Sir Charleroy;
but methinks we have forgotten how to pray aright,
or heaven has forgotten to answer us. We have been
praying and fighting for months only to find at last
that our prayers and our battlings are alike vain. I
fear there are no palm-bearing angels at hand.”</p>

<p>The horsemen slowly wended their way back to the
hill-top, overlooking Nazareth, on which they first
paused the night before. Again they halted to admire
the prospect, as well as to look for a route of
safe retreat. Nazareth was astir. The little band on
the hill could hear the morning trumpeters calling the
Moslem to worship.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the leader of the band on the
hill, “it is wisdom to divide into two parties, and
make for the sea by different routes. At Cæsarea we
may find some vessels with which to leave these to us
fateful shores. If we meet the foe anywhere, the
odds against us now are so great that death or enslavement
must be the result. Perhaps if there be
two parties one may escape.” The knights paused
about their leader a few moments in affectionate debate;
all opposing at first the plan that was to scatter
them, but all, finally, convinced that it was the highest
wisdom to go on their ways apart. Lots were cast by
the eleven, De Griffin not participating. Four were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
grouped in one party and seven in the other by the
result.</p>

<p>“I’ll join the weaker party, remembering the five
wounds of Jesus,” said Sir Charleroy, reining his steed
to the smaller company. A moment after he continued:
“Now, good souls, away with grief; part we
must; here and now. May God go tenderly with the
seven, a covenant number. Now make your wills;
then a brief farewell; then use the spur.”</p>

<p>“Wills?” said a Templar, and they all smiled in a
sickly way at the word. “We knights, boasting our
poverty, our holding of all we have in community,
know nothing of will-making.”</p>

<p>“True, the pelf we each have is small enough; a
few keep-sakes, our arms and such like; but our love is
something. Let’s will that, and if we’ve aught to say
before we die, we’d better say it now. There is work
ahead, and plenty of it. There will be no time for
<i>ante-mortem</i> statement when we meet the cimeters of
the Crescent.” So spoke Sir Charleroy. He continued,
“My slayer will take good care of my jewels.”
He commenced writing upon a bit of parchment,
using for rest the pommel of his saddle. In a few
moments he paused.</p>

<p>“Wilt thou read thine, that we may know how to
make ours, chief?” inquired one near him.</p>

<p>“A message to my mother; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Enough; that’s sacred.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but—no. Misery has knit us into one family.
I feel to confide.” So saying, he read his
writing, omitting only the portion that recited their
recent vicissitudes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And now, beloved mother, we turn from Nazareth
toward the sea with only a forlorn hope of
reaching it. I long to meet thee, but the longing
must, I fear, content itself in reaching out my heart’s
best love across the distant ocean toward thyself. It
is all I can give in return for the mysterious consciousness
that thine is a constant presence. My memory
teems with records of my life-long ingratitude toward
thyself, that gave me birth and all a loving heart
could bestow, and now I’m tasting bitterest remorse
for all those selfish days of mine. I wish I could
recall their acts. Take these words as my request for
pardon. I shall bind this little parchment scrap in my
belt in a vague hope that some way, some time, it may
reach thee. If it do, remember it is sent to bear to
thee, beloved mother, the assurance that thy once wayward
boy remembers now, as he has for months, as the
brightest, best, most exalting and blessed things of all
his life, thy loving words, thy patient trust in him and
all thy pious exhortations. I thank God now for all
my trials and perils. They have brought me to full
prizing of thy goodness and near to the religion thou
dost profess.”</p>

</div>

<p>The reader paused, and the companion knights at
once began begging him to inscribe messages for them
each, he being the only one in all the company
having the priestly gift of the pen. Most of them
said, “To my mother” or “To my sister, write;”
but one blushed as he said, “I’ve no mother nor
sister.” His comrades rallied him at once: “Name
her, the other only woman!”</p>

<p>“A heart as brave as thine, knight,” said the Hospitaler
to the blushing youth, “has a queen on its
throne, somewhere.”</p>

<p>The youth blushed more and drew away a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only a lover,” said the Templar. “Lovers, absent,
assuage their pinings by new mating! They forget;
mothers never do. Write for us, Sir Charleroy.”</p>

<p>The blush of the youth deepened to anger, evincing
his heart’s high protest against any hint of doubt
being aimed at his queen; but he was self-restraining,
silent. “I’ll not reveal her by defense even,” was his
whispered thought.</p>

<p>The writing was finished. “Farewell! Forward.”</p>

<p>The chief suited the action to the commands, and
soon his steed was dashing swiftly away with its
rider, followed by the others of his party. The seven
departed toward Nain; perhaps it was an ominous
choice, for their route led them toward the cave of
incantation, where Endor’s witch called up for Saul the
shade of Samuel. Most likely the words of the dead
prophet to the haunted warrior, “To-morrow thou
shalt be with me,” would have told the fate of the
seven that morning fittingly, for they were never
heard from by any of their earthly friends.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">A tedious ride brought the five knights
nigh Shunem, the City of Elijah.</p>

<p>“We’ll find no prophet’s chamber here
for such as we,” remarked Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said a comrade, “we may by force or
cajoling find a breakfast; a cake or cruse of oil.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” replied the chief, “we must try for a
little food. We can neither fight nor flee with gaunt
hunger on our flanks. Who knows, after all, but that
we may happen on a humane being in these parts.”</p>

<p>“Well, good captain, if we should find a Shulamite,
black, but comely, she might be as loving to thee as
that one of old was to Solomon, although——”</p>

<p>The sentence was broken off by the interrupting
command of Sir Charleroy, “Men, quick to cover; to
the lemon-tree grove on the right!”</p>

<p>A glance back revealed a host of armed men behind
the knights.</p>

<p>“All saints defend!” cried the Templar, as the little
band wheeled toward the refuge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The tale of the battle to the death that ensued, is
quickly told.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy, though he had fought with reckless
bravery, as one hotly pursuing death, alone survived.
A bludgeon blow felled him; when he recovered
consciousness, he beheld standing by his side a
gorgeously bedecked Moslem. The clangor of the
conflict was over; the blood in which he weltered, and
the vicious eyes that watched him, were all that reminded
the knight of what had recently transpired.
Presently the latter addressed the one that stood
guard:</p>

<p>“Why is the infidel so tardy in finishing his work?”</p>

<p>“Is the Crusader in a hurry to reach night?” sententiously
replied the man of gorgeous trappings.</p>

<p>“He would like to stay long enough to execute a
murderer—the chief of thy horde.”</p>

<p>“My horde? Thou knowest me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, ‘Azrael, Angel of Death,’ thy minions call
thee; but I defy thee as I loathe thee.”</p>

<p>The chief’s brow darkened; his sword rose in air,
and he exclaimed: “Hercules was healed of a serpent
bite, ages ago, at Acre; Islamism in the same
place recently; I must finish the hydra by cutting off
thy hissing head, Christian.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy steadily met his captor’s gaze, eye to
eye, and was silent.</p>

<p>The chief paused; then lowering his sword, toyed
its point against the cross on the prostrate man’s
breast.</p>

<p>“Bitter tongue, thou dost worship a death sign;
dost thou so love death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Death befriends those who wear that sign in truth;
this is my comfort standing now at the rim of earth’s
last night.”</p>

<p>“Thy bright red blood and unwrinkled brow bespeak
youth, the power to enjoy life. Youth and such
power is ever a prayer for more time; thou liest to thyself
and me by professing to seek thy end.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful! The ‘Angel of Death’ is a soul-reader
as well as a murderer!” bitterly rejoined Sir
Charleroy.</p>

<p>“Well, then, refute me! Here’s thy greasy, blood-stained
sword; now go, by thine own hands, if thou
darest, to judgment.”</p>

<p>“Trusting God, I may defy thee; yet not hurry
Him!”</p>

<p>“I like the Christian’s metal. I might let him live.”</p>

<p>“Life would be a mean gift now; a painful departure
from the threshold of Paradise, to renew weary
pilgrimages.”</p>

<p>“I may be merciful.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it.”</p>

<p>“Thou shalt.”</p>

<p>“When I believe in the tenderness of jackals and
tigers, in the sincerity of transparent hypocrisy, I’ll
praise the mercy of Azrael.”</p>

<p>“Our holy Koran reveals a bridge finer than a hair,
sharper than a sword, beset with thorns, laid over hell.
From that bridge, with an awful plunge, the wicked go
eternally down; over it safely, swiftly, the holy pass
to happiness. Art ready to try that bridge?”</p>

<p>“Ready for the land of forgetfulness; no swords nor
crescents are there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, thou wouldst only reach Orf, the partition of
hell, where the half-saints tarry; thy bravery merits that
much; but I’ll teach thee to reach better realms.”</p>

<p>“Turk, Mameluke, ’tis fiendish to prejudge a dying
soul; leave judgment to God, and share now all that is
within thy power, my body, with thy fit partners, the
vultures!”</p>

<p>“A living slave is worth more to me than a dead
knight; I’ve an humor to let thee live.”</p>

<p>“Oh, most merciful hypocrite! I did not think thou
couldst tell the truth so readily; but let me, I beseech
thee, be the dead knight.”</p>

<p>“What if I save thy life, teach thee the puissant
faith of Islam, give thee leadership, and with it opportunity
to win entrance to that highest Paradise, whose
gateway is overshadowed by swords of the brave?
There thou mayest dwell forever with Allah and the
adolescent houris.”</p>

<p>“Enough; unless thou dost aim to torture me! I’m
a Knight of Saint Mary, and thou full well knowest
the measure of my vows; how throughout this land my
Order has warred against thy hateful polygamy, thy
gilded lusts here, thy Harem heaven hereafter! Ye
thrive by luring to your standards men aflame now
with the fire that burns such souls at last in black perdition.
I tell thee to thy teeth, thou and thine are
living devils. But ye war against the wisdom of the
world and the law of God; though triumphing now, ye
will rot amid your riots and victories.”</p>

<p>The chief’s face grew black as night for an instant,
but recovering himself, he continued, sarcastically at
first, then with the zeal of a proselyter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Speak low, thou, last dying vestige of a wan faith!
Thou mightst make my solemn followers yell with ridiculing
laughter! I tell thee of life and of a faith as
natural as nature herself. Listen; there is for the brave
and faithful a Paradise whose rivers are white as milk
as odoriferous as musk. There are sights for the eye,
fetes most delicious and music never ceasing to ravish;
these lure the brilliantly-robed faithful to the black-eyed
daughters of Pleasure. One look at them
would reward such as we for a world-life of pain; and
the children of the prophet’s faith are given the
eternities to companion these splendid creatures whose
forms created of musk know no infirmity, but survive,
always, as adolescent fountains. The heaven of
Islamism is eternal youth, eternally luxurious.”</p>

<p>“It befits the Angel of Death to gild a deformed
hell with bedazzling words. Thou and thine glorify lust,
and thy heaven, like thy harem, is but a brothel after
all. Now let me blast thy gorgeous charnel-house
with the lightning of God’s Word: ‘Blessed are the
pure in heart for they shall see God!’”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy had raised himself up as he was speaking;
now he fell back, exhausted. He again felt the
glow in his heart that he felt on the quay when the
English bishop blessed him; but it seemed more real
now than then, and the approvings of conscience some
way came with rebukes that caused tears to flow. He
felt something akin to real penitence for a life that had
not been always up to the ideal that this debate had
caused him to exalt. As he fell back he closed his
eyes and turned his face from his captor; the act was a
prayer to be helped to shut out of his mind the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of gilded lust depicted by the false teacher that
stood by. For a few moments the wounded man was
left to his own thoughts, and then his heart went out
toward home crying like a sick or lost child in the
night, for “<i>Mother!</i>” Once more he returned to that
duality of existence which comes when one enters into
personal introspections. There seemed to be two Sir
Charleroys, one writing the history of the other, and
the writer was recording such estimates as these: “As
he lay there, nigh death, he drew near to God. He
had once been a rover, seeking the wildest pleasures of
the European capitals; but meeting passion, presented
as the ultimate of life, for all eternity, his soul recoiled
from it and he became the herald of purity. Once he
had friends, wealth and physical prowess; but he
squandered them as a prodigal; when he lay bleeding,
powerless in body, amid strangers, a slave, he rose to
the majesty of a moral giant.” The Sir Charleroy that
was thus reviewed was comforted, and he stood off
from the picture in imagination to admire it, as one
standing before a mirror. Just then he thought of his
mother and Mary, his ideal, standing on either side of
him, before the same presentment. It might have been
a dream; but he believed they smiled through tears,
pressed their beating hearts to his and upheld him by
their arms with tenderness and strength. His captor
left him for a few moments only, undisturbed. At a
sign from Azrael, he was soon carried away by a guard;
the parley was ended and he that had so bravely spoken
doomed to confront that that is to the vigorous mind
the worst of happenings, uncertainty. For months the
captive mechanically submitted to the fortunes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Sheik’s caravan; in health improving; in spirit depressed,
numbed. The knight had constantly before
him three grim certainties, escape impossible; rebellion
useless; each day hope darkened by further departure
from the sea. The captive’s treatment from the
Sheik was not unkind. The latter met him by times
with a sort of courtly condescension, varied only by an
occasional penetrating, questioning glance. They had
little conversation, yet the Sheik’s looks plainly said:
“When thou art subdued, sue for favors; they’ll be
granted.” De Griffin nursed his pride and firmness and
prevented all familiarity on Azrael’s part. The latter
was puzzled sometimes, sometimes angered; but he
was too polite to show his feelings. For months the
only conversation between the two alert, strong men
might be summed up in these words on the Sheik’s
part: “Slave, freedom and heaven are sweet.” “Knight,
Allah knows only the followers of the Prophet as
friends.” On the knight’s part a look of scorn or an
expression of disgust was the sole reply.</p>

<p>In the Sheik’s retinue was another captive, a Jew.
He was constantly near the knight; for being more
fully trusted than the latter, the Sheik had made the
Israelite in part the custodian of the Christian. The
knight discerned the relationship very quickly; though
both Jew and chief endeavored to conceal it. Sir
Charleroy, at the first, treated his companion captive
with loathing and resentment, as a spy. After a time,
the “sphinx, eyes open, mouth shut,” as Azrael
described Sir Charleroy, deemed it wise and politic to
make the Jew his ally. The resolution once formed,
he found many circumstances to aid in bridging the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
gulf that separated the captive and his guard; the cultured
Teutonic leader and the wandering Israelite.
They both hated the same man, their captor; both
loathed the religion he was covertly aiming to lure
them to; both were anxious for freedom. They gave
voice to these feelings when together, alone, and ere
long sympathy made them friends. The next step was
natural and easy; the stronger mind took the leadership
of the two, and Sir Charleroy became teacher; his
keeper became his pupil and <i>protégé</i>.</p>

<p>The twain one day, after this change of relation,
walked together conversing, on a hill overlooking Jericho,
by which place the Sheik’s caravan was encamped.</p>

<p>“Ichabod, thou wearest a fitting name.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, since my mother gave it. But why
say so now?”</p>

<p>“Ichabod, ‘glory departed,’ thou art like thy people—despoiled.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! how long?” piously exclaimed the Jew.</p>

<p>“Till Shiloh comes!”</p>

<p>“Verily it is so written,” was the Jew’s reply.</p>

<p>“But He has come, Israelite!”</p>

<p>“Where?” the startled Jew questioned, drawing
back as if he expected his, to him mysterious, companion
to throw back his tunic and declare: “<i>I am he!</i>”</p>

<p>“In the world and in my heart.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sir Knight, Israel’s desolation refutes all that.”</p>

<p>“Jew, thine eyes are veiled. I’ll teach thee to see
Him yet.”</p>

<p>The Jew was puzzled.</p>

<p>The twain fell into prolonged converse, and then
in that lone place the Crusader waxed eloquent, preaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Christ and Him crucified to one of Abraham’s
seed.</p>

<p>When the two captives descended to their tents,
each was conscious of a new, peculiar joy. One had the
joy of having proclaimed exalted truth, faithfully, to the
almost persuading of his hearer; the other was moving
about in the growing delight and wonder of a new
dawning faith.</p>

<p>At frequent intervals Ichabod besought the knight
to take him “<i>to the mountain</i>.”</p>

<p>Each visit thither was a delight to the new inquirer.</p>

<p>On such a journey one day spoke Ichabod: “Christian,
I am consumed with anxiety to hear thy words
and another anxiety lest they do me harm. I am
thinking, thinking, by day, and, what little time my
thoughts permit sleep, I’m filled with wondrous dreams!
I fear to lose my old faith, and yet it becomes like
Dead Sea apples under the light of this new way. So
new, so infatuating. None I’ve met, and I’ve met
many, ever so moved me. Why, knight, I’ve traversed
half the world; sometimes as wealth’s favorite, sometimes
of necessity in misfortune; I’ve seen the faiths
of Egypt and India in their homes, and walked amid
the temples of great Rome, but with abiding contempt
for all not Israelitish. Not so this creed of the knight
affects me.”</p>

<p>“And for good reason; I offer thee the true, new,
refined and final Judaism!”</p>

<p>“It seems so, and yet I tremble. I dare not doubt;
that’s sin; but here’s the puzzle that harasses me:
What if, in doubting these things I’m now told, I be
doubting the very truth, the Jewish faith!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ichabod, thy heart has been a buried seed awaiting
the spring. It has come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, knight, I’m trusting my dear soul to thee.
As a dog his master, a maid her lover, so blindly I
follow thee. I can not go back: I can not pause nor
can I go onward alone. I’m in the misery of a joy too
great to be borne, almost, and yet too much my master
to be given up. Oh, knight, thou art so wise, so
strong! Steady me; hold me up! I can only pray
and adjure thee to be sincere with me; only sincere;
that’s all; as sincere as if thou wert ministering to the
ills of a sick man battling death.”</p>

<p>The child of Abraham, with a sudden movement,
flung his arms with all vehemence about Sir Charleroy.
The East and the West embracing, truth leading, love
triumphant.</p>

<p>“Poor Ichabod, if thou hadst no soul, thy clingings
and yearnings would bind me to thee faithfully. Thou
hast tried to give me charge over that that is immortal.
A Higher Being has it in loving trust; were it not so,
I’d turn in dread from thy confiding!”</p>

<p>“Is mine so bad a soul, master?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no. Its preciousness to Him that created
it, is what would make me dread its partial custody.”</p>

<p>“Thou’lt help me, master, now?”</p>

<p>“For three objects I’ll willingly die; my mother;
our lady, and the soul of one who abandons himself, as
thou, to my poor pilotage.”</p>

<p>“Then, thou strangely lovest me. Oh, this but more
persuades me that thy faith is right; it makes thee so
good to a stranger, a slave, a hated Jew!”</p>

<p>“But then we are so apart and so unlike each other!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Jew, I want to show that humanity is one.
The very creed I’m trying to teach thee and would fain
have all thy race, ay, all mankind fully understand, is
full of love, joy, peace. These follow it as naturally as
the flower the stem, the humming the flying wing
made to fly and be musical.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear light, with thee I’m in joy and wilderment.
Thy presence seems to bring me hosts of
crowned truths, all seeking to enter my being. I feel
like a tired runner ready to faint when thou’rt absent,
but when thou talkest the tired runner is plunged into a
cooling ocean, whose circling waves, as it were charged
with the stimulus of tempered lightnings, glowing with
a million rainbows, overwhelm, lift up and rest him.
I’m floating thereon now!”</p>

<p>“Thy strange fancies make me wonder, Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“Wonder; why my strength dies from over wonder.
I was ill for hours yesterday. Light to my sweat-blinded,
feverish eyes, all calm and healing, comes
when I yield to thy will; but still all my joy is
haunted by ghosts which rise in day-mare troops,
pointing rebukingly to labyrinths into which I seem
to be pushed. I sometimes wonder if I’m seeing real
spirits or going mad.”</p>

<p>“Dost pray, Jew?”</p>

<p>“I dare not live without praying!”</p>

<p>“Then tell the All Pitiful what thou hast this day
told to me. He loves the sincere, down to the deepest
hell of doubt, and from it all, at last, will lead
tumulted souls safely. An honest doubt is a real
prayer, well winged; quickly it reaches heaven, at
whose portal it dies to rise again all peace.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Jew and Crusader came to love each other
after the manner of David and Jonathan,
and they were both made stronger and
happier men on account of this loving.</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy, a year gone to day, thou and I climbed
to glory.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast a prolific imagination or I a poor memory.
I have no remembrance of either climbing or
glory of a year ago.”</p>

<p>“I may well remember the greatest day of my life;
the day thou tookst me up yon hill over against Jericho;
I saw, as Elisha, in the presence of his great master
Elijah, the mountains, that day, full of the chariots
and angels of God.”</p>

<p>“But, Jew, the chariot separated Elijah and Elisha;
we were, in thy ‘great day,’ made one.”</p>

<p>“True, but I got the prophet’s insight and power. Oh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
now I see Shiloh coming in the redemption of Jew and
Gentile.”</p>

<p>“Radiant proselyte, give God, not me the glory.”</p>

<p>“I’ll call thee, knight, Jordan—my Jordan.”</p>

<p>“The Jew rambles amid strange conceptions. Why
am I like that mighty stream?”</p>

<p>“Its bed and banks, God’s cup; they nobly serve,
catching the pure waters of mountain springs and
heaven’s clouds, to bear them, mingled with sweet Galilee,
to the black burning lips of Sodom’s plains below.
I was a dead sea, alive alone to misery; nothing to me
but my historic past, and that sin-stained. I’m now
refreshed and purified; sometime there’ll be life growing
about me!”</p>

<p>“The highlands of Galilee gather from heaven,
oceans of sweet, pure water, which Jordan, year after
year, night and day, hurries down to the Asphalt
sea; but still that sea remains lifeless and bitter.
Even so, the clean, white truth comes to some, life-long,
yet vainly. I think I’m little like Jordan, but
much like that sea.”</p>

<p>“And yet, knight, all is not vain that seems so. I
learned this once, long ago, in the vale of Siddim, by
the sea of Lot. As I entered that place of desolation
I thought of Gehenna! The lime cliffs about, all
barren and pitiless as the walls of a furnace, shut out
the breezes, and intensified the sun’s scorching rays.
A solemn stillness, unbroken by wind, wave or voice of
life, was there; suffocating, plutonic odors ladened the
air, and a fog hung over that watery winding sheet of
the cities of the plain. I watched that overhanging
cloud until my heated brain shaped it into a vast company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of shades; the ghostly forms of the overwhelmed
denizens of those accursed habitations, now in mute
terror and confusion, holding to one another desperately;
fearing to go to final judgment. Once I thought
they were together trying to look down into the depths,
perchance to seek for vestiges of their ancient, earthly
habitations. These fancies grew and grew upon me,
mad dreamer that I was, until I was nigh to desperate
fright; but I found some little angels on the shore
who comforted.”</p>

<p>“Angels at Sodom?”</p>

<p>“Even so. The first was light and liquid silver; it
sang a bar of nature’s tireless, varied melody by my footsteps.
Ah, the little, fresh spring that burst forth
through the rim of the crystalline basin, was an angel to
me. Then I found others here and there. At first I was
glad, then I began to pity them, and to wish I could
change their courses. They all wended their ways to
the desolate sea, and their sweet currents were swallowed
up in the yawning gulf of death. ‘Vainly,’ I
said at first. Then I saw other angels in the forms of
bending willows, and gorgeous oleanders. Just then it
all came to me; the springs, though small and few,
were not in vain. The oleanders and the willow, whose
roots kissed their fresh life, were evidences that the
springs had been for good. Aye, more, the flowers rejoiced
me in those desolations more than could the
rose gardens of the Temple in days of happiness.
Yea, knight, thou hast been a rivulet to Ichabod in a
day when he wandered as among arid mountains and
dead seas.”</p>

<p>“Blest child of Abraham, thy faith is great, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I be but a pitiable guide; yet I’ll adopt thy similes.
Be thou and I, to each other, Jordan, rivulet and
flower by turn; the fresh current gives life to plant and
blossom, while plant and blossom both shade and beautify
the streams. With both it shall be well, if we well
learn to seek deep for the hidden springs of the life
that can never die. Already thou hast blessed me very
greatly, gathering truths I failed to find. Thou return’st
to me multiplied all I bestow.”</p>

<p>“Would I could gather for all; for my race, so
blinded! Oh, it is a tristful thought that the nearer I
get to God, the further I get from them I love next
after Him. Even my mother was wont to say to me,
when, as a questioning boy, I inquired beyond the
traditions of the Rabbis, that she’d disown me to all
eternity as a heretic. My belief has made me an outcast
to her, and yet the thought of her hating me tears
my heart.”</p>

<p>“I’ll love thy orphaned heart.”</p>

<p>“Me? Love me; so far beneath thee and with such
pauper power of payment?”</p>

<p>“Thy desolation makes thee rich; having none other
to love, thou canst love me the more. Thou know’st
this open secret of loving; its selfishness demands all;
getting that it gives all. Fear not Ichabod, but that
thou’lt find the hunger of thy heart well fed. It is as
natural for us to love those we have helped as to hate
those we have harmed. Thou know’st how men wonder
that the Infinite can love the finite, but they forget,
or never realized, that one may love because he
has loved. So is it with God. He loves, and that He
loves becomes therefore rich and worthful to Him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The morning after the betrothal, shall we call it, of
these two men to each other, long before dawn the
knight was wakened by a cautious step on the stone
floor of his sleeping place. Sir Charleroy was at once
all alert and leaped from the couch, sword in hand,
expecting to confront some gipsy thief, for there had
been a band of these wanderers hovering near the day
before.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” sternly he demanded, advancing,
on guard meanwhile.</p>

<p>“Ichabod, Ichabod!” with trembling voice and in a
half whisper. It was the Jew.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to fright thee,” he hurriedly
explained, when he had recovered from his fear of
being thrust through, “but I’ve news; bad news that
would not wait!”</p>

<p>“What is the bad? Is it near?”</p>

<p>“Oh, knight, speak low—the news is bad enough
and the ill, though not on us, close after us!”</p>

<p>“Thou art excited, my friend; sit down and then
unfold the matter. Meanwhile I’ll light a faggot.”</p>

<p>“In truth, I can’t sit, and I’ve reason to be nervous.”
Then the man spread out his arms and his fingers as if
he would stand all ready to fly; his eyes wide open,
staring as he talked.</p>

<p>“Our Sheik leaves Jericho to-morrow; summoned by
the sheriff of Mecca. The sheriff is supreme to
Moslem. The command is for war toward the east.
Blood, blood; when will the world be done shedding
blood!”</p>

<p>“Well, my loving alarmist,” replied Sir Charleroy,
coolly, “that’s not very bad news. If the Sheik leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
us, we’ll be free; if he takes us, there will be a change
and for that I could almost cry ‘Blessed be Allah!’ I
am sickened, crushed, dry-rotted by this hum-drum
life; this slavery; dancing abject attendance on a gluttonous
master, whose sole object seems to be eating or
dallying about the marquees of his harem.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sir Charleroy, the change has dreadful things
for us!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I heard that the runner bringing the mandate from
Mecca brings also command that all prisoners, such as
we, must be made to embrace Islamism, enlist to die,
if need be, in this so-called holy war, or be sent to the
slave mart.”</p>

<p>“This is a carnival for the furies! Why, Ichabod,
the latter is burial alive; the former death with a dishonored
conscience!”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy, I prefer the slavery.”</p>

<p>“Well, I prefer neither. Is the mandate final?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve an order to commence packing at sunrise;
by noon we will be enlisted or in chains.”</p>

<p>“Who gave thee these state secrets, so in detail?
Perhaps ’tis only camp-fire gossip recounted for lack of
novel ghost stories.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ’tis too true. I’d swear my life on it!”</p>

<p>“Rash, credulous; but which now, comrade, I can
not tell.”</p>

<p>“Master, I had this from one that loves me as I love
thee; the young Nourahmal, light of the harem,
favorite of the Sheik.”</p>

<p>“Well, now it seems to me that this light of the
harem is thy favorite rather than the Sheik’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“She adores me.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless! Where a woman unfolds her mind
there she brings all else an offering easily possessed.
She seals her change of allegiance by scattering the
secrets of the dethroned to the enthroned lover.
‘Nourahmal’? Is she as charming in form as in name?”</p>

<p>“Hold, now! If thou lov’st me thou will’st not
continue thus to wound. I love that girl, but not the
way thou meanest!”</p>

<p>“So? Is there an elopement pending?”</p>

<p>“Unworthy gibe! Say no more like it, but answer
this: Is it not possible for a man and woman to be knitted
together in soul, as I and thou have been, without
the shadow of a remembrance that they are animals of
different sexes?”</p>

<p>“Possible? Really I do not know. It may be possible,
but so very rare that I have failed to hear of any
such relationship.”</p>

<p>“Then thou shalt hear of it now in Nourahmal and
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take both to Paris! Another wonder of the
world! But explain further.”</p>

<p>“My Nourahmal is a captive; hates the man to
whom she must submit as we hate him, and loves me
with the new love that you have revealed to me,
because I’ve shown her that I love her that way; so
different from any thing she ever knew before.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are many women yoked to men for
whom they feel no great affection, yet they glorify
womanhood by their unfaltering loyalty. Loyalty is
woman’s glory; the hope of society. If the women
be traitors, then, alas!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nourahmal is not a wife! The man that parcels
out his heart to a dozen favorites buys but scraps in
return. A woman in misery’s chains, without the
bands of the confiding, utter love of her lord, will talk;
she must talk, or go mad. I tell, thee, knight, such gossip
is the panacea of suicidal bent. There’s many a
woman kills herself for lack of a confidant!”</p>

<p>“Thou hast learned much philosophy going around
the world, Jew, but perhaps not this bitter truth; the
woman who is traitor to one man will be to another.
Thou mayst be the next. What if she set us fleeing for
the sake of laughing at our forced return?”</p>

<p>“Impossible, knight; she reveres me truly; even
as she does God; just as I did Sir Charleroy when he
brought me light and rest. I was to her what thou
art to me. One day I told her women had souls, as
dear to heaven as the souls of men! She laughed at
me like a monkey, at first, and reminded me that were I
a true disciple of Islam I’d know that only young and
beautiful women go to heaven, and they even there
have a lowly place. Thou knowest these infidels believe
that the large majority of hellions are women.”</p>

<p>“Not strange Jew; they treat women as pretty or
useful animals, and so degrade, not only themselves, but
these very women. A woman so demeaned does not
become heavenly, to say the least. But I think, if I
were a Turk, I’d keep only argus-eyed eunuchs to
guard my harem; in faith, I’d even have the tongues
out of those guards.”</p>

<p>“There, now, thou dost jest again.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on, in seriousness. Tell us the pipings of
this seraglio beauty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve won her over completely.”</p>

<p>“This is not strange. Poets are always valiant, victorious
orators with women. The female heart is
emotionally moved up to belief with little logic, if the
speaker be fair, or musical, or brave!”</p>

<p>“I was none of these; I told her of the ‘Friend of
Publicans and Sinners;’ that fed her soul. I do not
believe there is a woman on earth that can resist that
story.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’m not going to forget that the first
woman outran her mate in evil, nor that she exchanged
the All Beautiful for the snaky demon.”</p>

<p>“It would be nobler for a knight, truer for all, to
judge, if judge they will, by wider circles. Do not remember
the sin of one, or a few, to the disparagement
of all!”</p>

<p>“Eve, the best made of all, fell; then her weaker
sisters are more likely to follow in her way,” said the
knight.</p>

<p>“She found a sin and fell: thousands of her daughters
have fallen by sins that men invented and thrust
on them. Thou knowest that most women who go
wrong, go in ways they would not without the temptings
of the stronger will. The sin that ruins most is
that to woman’s nature abhorrent, until honeyed over
by the tongue of man.”</p>

<p>“Dexterous lance, art thou, Jew; but, anyway, some
women are born bad.”</p>

<p>“No; I’m not able for one so wise as the knight,
unless I’ve the strength of truth. I’ve heard that our
wise men say that if we could trace the ancestry of any
one evil, from birth, we would find somewhere, up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
line, a father, prëeminent in wickedness. Say, women
are weak to resist evil; then, say men are strong to
propagate it. Now, which way turns the scale?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say always, dogmatically, if need be, in man’s
favor.”</p>

<p>“Let me see: Eve’s humanity that sinned was out of
the finest part of Adam’s body, and the serpent which
betrayed her was a male.”</p>

<p>“I’ll parry the thrust by asking why the Holy Writings
reveal no female angels? I think there are none.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a wiser reason, knight. It is this: Man has so
foully dealt with the angels in the flesh that God’s
mercy reserves their finer spiritual counterparts for the
sole companionships of heaven, which justly appreciates
these holy, pure and tender creations. Heaven
would not be perfectly beautiful without them and,
methinks, can not spare one for a moment!”</p>

<p>“Not even to minister to a needy world?”</p>

<p>“Woman’s life is here, generally, all service, all ministry;
her return to earth after death would be a work
of supererogation. God sends back the male spirits
to help restore the world their sex did most to ruin.”</p>

<p>Then both the debaters laughed out as heartily as
they dared, but there was in the tones of the knight’s
laughter a part-confession of defeat. After a time
Sir Charleroy spoke again: “Thou art calm now, after
this diversion, Ichabod; proceed with thy story of
danger.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nourahmal——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, begin again with Nourahmal. Samson was
a pretty good man for a giant, but he had a betraying
Delilah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“True enough; but he had also a noble mother. Remember
the better, rather than the worse.”</p>

<p>“I remember her peers, Mary and my mother.”</p>

<p>“So, then, when sweepingly condemning all the sex,
please except the mothers, at least of those who may
be thy hearers.”</p>

<p>“Good Jew, I’ll not wound thee!”</p>

<p>“No pity for me; pity thyself. Such thoughts as
thou hast spoken wound thine own soul. We Jews
have an order called ‘Tumbler Pharisees;’ they affect
humility, shuffle as they walk and stumble on purpose
that they may not seem to walk with confidence.
Akin to them we have the ‘Bleeding Pharisees;’ they
walk with shut eyes, lest they should see a woman, and,
stumbling against many a post, are soon covered with
their own blood, receiving real harm in flying from
imaginary dangers.”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Maya, Maya</i>,’ Ichabod,” laughing aloud, exclaimed
Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>The latter, catching the knight’s arm, hoarsely
whispered: “Hush! Thou mayst be heard. What
dost thou mean by ‘<i>Maya</i>’?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Nourahmal! <i>Maya</i> was the reputed wife
of the supposed god Brahm of the Hindus. It is
reported that she was in form like unto fog and her
name means ‘illusion.’ A subtle truth, Jew; even a
god, in love, is near a fog bank!”</p>

<p>“Thou dost not know Nourahmal and dost discredit
her; that’s slander; thou dost know me and ridiculest
me; that’s—but—I’ll not say it.”</p>

<p>“I’d not pain my Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“Nor discredit Nourahmal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; but did this angel, or Syren of thine, having
shown the peril, present a map to a city of refuge?”</p>

<p>“Ah, poor, helpless girl! she has none for herself,
much less for us. She just told me all and wept and
kissed me a farewell, praying me to flee. I could think
of no question in the delight of hearing her say, she
hoped I’d meet her in Heaven, in peace away from
Moslem and wars. Only think of her faith! All new;
just a little while ago she did not know there was a
heaven for women. I felt I could die then in peace.
I’ve taught one woman that she is more than a pretty
animal!”</p>

<p>“Then, Jew, to thee, life is worth living?”</p>

<p>“Oh truly! Oh, if this light could only spread over
Egypt and all my own Syria!”</p>

<p>“Thy desire is akin to that of Mary’s son and noble.
Certain it is that we can not spread that light by fighting
to sustain the fateful Crescent.”</p>

<p>“By the glory of God, I never will.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, son of Abraham; so let’s decline.”</p>

<p>“And go to the slave mart?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not while I’ve a sword, Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“Then to flee is the word?”</p>

<p>“The eastern campaigning with the sheik, would
be a little longer route to Paradise?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; I am assured that we are needed of
God by the use He has recently made of us. He will
keep us in our flight from bloody persecuting war, and
possible apostacy.”</p>

<p>“I hate the last word! A knight enchanted of Mary
can never become a renegade; not I, at least. I was
born October ninth. Tradition says that the holy St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
John Damascene, having had his hand cut off by the
Saracens that day, was by Our Lady miraculously
made whole, and lived long after to wield a powerful,
facile pen in her behalf. I’ll trust my head and saber
hand, used for her, to her protection.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll trust Him that led the wandering hosts
of Moses; for ‘in all their affliction, He was afflicted
with them, and the angel of His presence saved
them; and He bore them and carried them all the
days of old.’ Oh, master, I’ve comfort I can not tell,
when I feel orphaned, by thinking of my Maker,
not only as a Father, but as a Mother! God is
our Mother when we, bereft of mother-love, most
feel our need of it. So thou toldst me in the mountains.”</p>

<p>“True; but shall we try our escape now?”</p>

<p>“Nay, we had better wait till a little before dawn;
the camp patrol is then withdrawn; then we’ll embrace
freedom.”</p>

<p>“The Jew seems very confident.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I spent the hour after I met Nourahmal (God
keep her), amid the palms for which Jericho is fitly
named, and got a token.”</p>

<p>“A token?”</p>

<p>“My eyes were touched in the darkness.”</p>

<p>“Sweet Nourahmal followed thee?”</p>

<p>“No, but He that opened the eyes of blind Bartimeus
near here.”</p>

<p>“What didst thou see?”</p>

<p>“Elisha healing the streams about this palm city,
type of God healing the floods of bitterest fates; after
that I saw Jericho’s walls falling at the blasts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Joshua’s trumpets, and remembered that his God then
is ours now.”</p>

<p>“Didst thou see two poor men fleeing in the dark
from peril to peril, pursued by a hundred horsemen,
who saber-lashed them; a little further two corpses, one
of a Christian the other of a Jew, on which fed fighting
jackals?”</p>

<p>“I saw no such horror! I saw two led forth from
their captors, as Peter from his dungeon; the angels
that blinded the eyes of the monstrous men, who of
old sought to defile Lot’s house, blinded the eyes of
the pursuers of the two; and the angel of Peter gave
them guidance and light. But come, the night-guard
has retired; between now and the call to morning
prayers is our opportunity.”</p>

<p>Out of the old stone stable silently knight and Jew
glided, threading their way amid splendors they believed
to be, but could not see. The ministering
spirits were over and around them, their path was
through the Kelt, the sublimest waddy of Palestine;
but night shrouded the latter; their weak faith dimly
discerned the other.</p>

<p>“Can’t thou see any way-marks, Jew?”</p>

<p>“I discern but few. Yet, what matter? It is enough
that He who leads us sees?”</p>

<p>“The night is getting blacker and blacker; the omen
makes my heart shiver as it beats.”</p>

<p>As the knight spoke there came a terrific crash of
thunder and a succession of blinding lightning flashes.
Sir Charleroy clasped the Jew’s arm and in startled
voice questioned:</p>

<p>“Dost thou not fear these?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why should I? The angel guides swing the torches
of the unchangeable Father to give us glimpses of our
way. All is well; I saw by the lightning flash that we
are passing safely the camp lines of our captors.”</p>

<p>A few miles were over-past. The storm had abated
a little, and the first streaks of dawn, like spears, were
rising in the east.</p>

<p>“Would God, good Jew,” said the now wearied Sir
Charleroy, “that the Prophet of the Moslem, who, near
by here, is said once by a stamp of his foot to have
brought forth from the rock a camel, were present to
dance for us now.”</p>

<p>“He is not here, so we must help ourselves, knight.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear man, canst thou dance rocks into
camels?”</p>

<p>“No, but there are houses nigh, and each thou
knowst has it’s stable-yard in front.”</p>

<p>“But there is the thorny nubk tree, surrounding the
herds.”</p>

<p>“I’ve faith to try my faith when all I have is
faith.”</p>

<p>“What for; to steal a camel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I’d not steal a camel but I’d borrow a
couple of them. Two; for I’m not one of the knights
who exhibit poverty, by riding double, thou dost
know.”</p>

<p>“Borrow? Well so be it; the black infidels owe us
for two years’ service. They borrowed us!”</p>

<p>“It’s pious to take the beasts; for we pay so honest
debts of these heathens and shorten the list of their
souls’ sins by removing from them, in our escape, the
opportunity for our murder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“If this be sophistry, Ichabod, it is so sweet that it
is taken as delightful truth.”</p>

<p>“Thou art persuaded?”</p>

<p>“No man can out run me, be he rabbi or priest, in
condemning vices, if they be such as I do not care to
practice, and I am a profound believer in every creed
that’s sweet to my desires. Here action treads the
heels of persuasion.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On beasts, borrowed without formality, the fugitives
hurried toward Jordan, only there to find a barrier to
their progress in the angry torrent swelled by the
recent storms. It was clearly futile to attempt a passage,
and to tarry, waiting the ebb of the waters, was
to bring certain detection. They turned the heads of
their borrowed camels toward their master’s homes and
waited the sunrise, meanwhile moving about to find
some means of safety.</p>

<p>“Well, my comrade, I think it will not be long until
those Turks will give our souls an Elijah-like ascension
except that there will be no chariot. The morning
shimmering on his mountain makes me think of this,
Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“The tracks of our returning camels in the wet
earth will guide our pursuers.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we climb a tree as Zacchaeus, since we can
not have a chariot. By my plume! which I’ve not
seen for a year, I think that would be safety; the
Turks never look up except in prayer, and the wolf
Azrael seldom prays. But God pity us! there they are
coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“To the tombs, master! On the left.”</p>

<p>“Refuge for jackals?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but also for the miserable, living and dead!
Now haste!”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy obeyed quickly, but recoiled with a
groan of disgust as he suddenly pushed against an
entombed body. He touched his hilt, as if determined
to abandon attempt at flight, and then, overcoming the
rash impulse to confront the pursuers, turned about,
seized the corpse, and dragging it from its place, hurled
it over the river bank into the torrent. He was in the
dispoiled nich in an instant. A cry from the pursuers
drew him forth. “See, Ichabod, the Turks are running
along the river banks watching the mummy bobbing
along in the torrent. See, it sinks. Ah, the
brutes, how they shout! They think that body
alive, and that one poor slave is hounded to death.”</p>

<p>“Jehovah Jeireh, now help us; they’ll soon be back,”
cried Ichabod.</p>

<p>“Ah, I forgot; they’ll remember there were two of
us.”</p>

<p>“Calm, Sir Knight, ‘By this sign I conquer,’ quoting
thy words of another. I’ll go forth; the only one
left; at least so they’ll think.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy turned and looked at the Jew, and was
amazed to see him binding in front of himself a board
having the ominous words, “Unclean” upon it.</p>

<p>“What; thou, a Jew, and touch that foul thing, worn
to festering death by some leper!”</p>

<p>“Better night and a clean soul, though in a body
burned by the cursed leprosy, than life in Moslem
slavery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what if the disease cleave to thee, and we
escape?”</p>

<p>“Sir Knight, thou wilt live to tell others that a once
hated Jew was led of thee to truth, and after died a
living death, that his benefactors might survive. I
think such deeds cause noble lights to glow in human
souls.”</p>

<p>“God bless and pity thee, Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he does; even now. I see the scarlet line of
Rahab, and it binds the pestilence that walketh by
noonday.”</p>

<p>The furious pursuers spurred their steeds up toward
the tombs, but as they beheld the solitary man, sitting
in painful attitude with beggar-like palm extended and
wearing the dread sign, they rapidly wheeled their
steeds about and galloped away. The Moslem had
heard that a Jew would suffer any torture rather than
ceremonial pollution; hence judged that the object
before them could not be the refugee they sought.</p>

<p>“I wonder not that the demoniac cut himself madly
when among the tombs, good Jew. Sure it’s like going
to glory to get out once more. Methinks freedom is
only sweet when taken with fresh air! Well, we are
out and the enemy thwarted.”</p>

<p>“Methinks, master, that the leper that died here,
leaving no legacy but the sign of his death, did some
good in unknowingly making me his heir.”</p>

<p>“And the corpse I disposed of so unceremoniously
left me a house of safety, though small and musty.
I’ve a bitter thought.”</p>

<p>“So, Sir Charleroy, tell it me, perhaps I can sweeten
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“I, the heir for a little time of that soulless clay, am
like it.”</p>

<p>“Not much being here and alive.”</p>

<p>“I rather think like it. See me tossed about by
strangers, robbed of my rights, helpless to resist fate’s
tides, begrudged the room I occupy, and not one who
once knew me to weep over my besetments.”</p>

<p>“Sir Knight, the miracles of our frequent preservation
should make our murmurings dumb.”</p>

<p>In the evening Jordan ebbed a little and the two
wanderers passed over. Nor did they regret the consequent
immersing in its flood. No word was spoken
as they passed through the current, for, before they
entered, having remembered that at this Bethabara
ford man’s Savior was baptized, they were each busy
with his own meditations. When they stood on the
other shore, Sir Charleroy reverently said: “Comrade,
I prayed as we passed that we might have the dove of
peace henceforth above our souls at least.”</p>

<p>“I prayed on my part that God would accept the act
as the Christian’s typical burial to the world and separation
from its sins.”</p>

<p>“How like death and birth is that beautiful type.
They level all life.”</p>

<p>“Are our lives leveled? knight.”</p>

<p>“Henceforth; and we are brethren.”</p>

<p>“And our King and Savior was baptized here by the
herald of His Kingdom, John?”</p>

<p>“Yea; here the new Judaism was formally inaugurated.
Tradition says also that Jesus baptized his
mother afterward at this ford.”</p>

<p>“How filial; how beautiful; how expressive! He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
was her God, yet her son, she his mother and disciple;
and each by all ties and forms bound together in a fellowship
of helpfulness.”</p>

<p>“The Jew’s an interpreter.”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy sweetens my trust as Jordan sweetens
the bitter waters of Bahr Lut.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Good morning and a blessing, comrade.” It
was the greeting of the Jew to the knight
who lay asleep under a palm the day after
the flight. The sleeper slowly rising,
murmured:</p>

<p>“I’m half vexed at thee, Ichabod; thou hast dissolved
a dream filled with sights of home and mother.”</p>

<p>“I’ve brought lentils, barley, and grape-clusters;
they are better than dreams when the sun is up.”</p>

<p>“To those sad when awake, joyful dreams are welcome.”</p>

<p>“There are real joys just before us.”</p>

<p>“Real joys, just before us? Grim sarcasm; a sorry
jest, Jew!”</p>

<p>“No; oh, no. I’m telling thee the smiling, clean-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
truth. We’ll be safe at Jabbock’s city by sun
set!”</p>

<p>“Safe? safe? I’m unused to that word; almost
afraid of it. What does it mean in this country?”</p>

<p>“Oh, these cavalrymen! always on the charge; now
here, now there. Thy thoughts go by habit, sometimes
racing forward, sometimes retreating. A while
ago thou wert as full of faith as Gideon, now thou art
as timorous as Canaan’s spies.”</p>

<p>“My habits have grown fat by feeding on piebald
experiences.”</p>

<p>“Experience is a lying prophet, when it counts without
reckoning God.”</p>

<p>“I can not see a step ahead. That’s certainty to
me, though thou callest it doubt. I know not how to
hang rainbows upon the ghostly brows of the future
when I’ve no power to lay hand on the ghostly form
and have no rainbows.”</p>

<p>“He that lifted the burdens of the past from off us
holds the changing winds of the future in His fists.
One second of life goes ever with only one second of
care. I learned this of Sir Charleroy long ago. Now
he forgets his own teachings. Shall I call him Reuben,
never excelling because unstable as water?”</p>

<p>“Call me slave: Uncertainty’s slave! Thou didst
waken me from a dream of home, to the shock of
remembering again that I was homeless, dead to all
that once made life worth living. The gorgeous hopes
of thy fertile mind are mocked by stern present facts.”</p>

<p>“Odd talk from one just dreaming of his mother; a
good woman didst say? then very hopeful; all good
women are. Then remember how thou didst lift me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to the very gates of heaven yesterday. Thou canst not
see a step ahead? Well, then look back; miles; years.
Was not our God in thy battles in the thickets; in the
mountains; in Jordan? My poor reasoning tells me
that He has wrought too much for us to drop us
now. He must get His reward in keeping us to the
end.”</p>

<p>“Some of the past makes me shudder, Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“Pick out the best, not the worst. We escaped the
very Gehenna at Jericho, following murderers, the
storm, slavery; now free, fed, rested, the eastern air
washed and sunned to a tonic. I’m drinking lotus balm
out of it.”</p>

<p>“There it is; the sun’s in thy brain, poet-preacher.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m only giving thee back some of thine own
sermons. I draw from my own heart no monster
memories. If I’ve fought hard battles it sufficeth
that I have fought them once. I’ll not recall their
bloody sweat and tears for the sake of refighting them.
No, I’m going back to the sweet, happy hours of babyhood;
for I tell thee, knight, there is a world of joy to
a man, scorched by stern experience, to forget himself
sometimes back to the lullabys and warblings of the
days of his innocence.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help doing it, especially in this place! My
whole being feeds on a present scent of home.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest the country hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“My soul laughs in friendly converse with these
crocuses, pinks, and asphodels, turning the velvet,
grassy plains to palace carpets. I’m saying to myself
these blossoms must know me, their bowing heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and offered odors being my reward for nursing their
mothers when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, flowers are sincere friends; they never change
and are all charitable. That’s why they are deemed fit
presents to those in prison, or proper offering to be laid
on the breast of the dead Magdalene.”</p>

<p>“Ah, dead Magdalene; for even the symbol of a
broken promise; born to be a queen of love, by perverted
love dethroned! Woman, man’s ward, by man
betrayed; the guide star setting in black night; the
savior of human purity befouling all purity! Given
the power by which Eve was to crush the serpent’s
head and using it to breed all serpentine ills. This is
Eve turning a volcano upon Eden. Put flowers upon
her once passionate, now dead, heart, in awful contrast!
Nature at her worst is intensified anguish; at her best
an ocean of joy, an universe of light and song. So I
learn of nature under man. Listen to nature’s perfumed
throb now: these thousands of feathered songsters,
millions of lesser creatures, whose melody is
larger than themselves and more perceptible. Hear
the humming, thrumming, buzzing, trumpetings.
Oh, this is life as the All-Saving tuned it to utter
joy! It widens, deepens, thickens; getting sweeter,
louder, happier all the way. A tempest, set to music,
knight. I’m caught in its whirl and join in its praisings.
It comes over me as an insight of what nature
really is. God cares for it all and made it thus, to
throb and exult!” Ichabod paused in transport.
“But I sometimes think there’s a great waste of these
things; there is so much in places where there is no
human ear or eye to hear or see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reuben is narrow-viewed just now. Man is not
all! God makes happiness because He is so full of
goodness He must. Our rabbis call Him ‘The Fountain.’
There is no waste! He makes these things for
His own joy, and, methinks, looks down from the circle
of the heavens to say to what is in the desert or wilderness,
‘Very good.’ Then, beyond this, I’ve sometimes
thought He kept the processions of joy and beauty
moving along; coming, going, dying, living, ending and
beginning again, as a sort of practice; by action keeping
all fresh and new. He causes things of beauty and
power to pass through His divine alchemy from one
glory to another, as the general causes his squadrons
to move through the evolutions of the battle before
the conflict. The Father is awaiting man’s hour, man’s
return from sinning; the time for millennial advent;
then all delights, as if fresh born, all goods newly harvested,
will appear to be multiplied, intensified, transfigured.
That will be the beginning of hereafter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Israel, the sun is in thy brain. I forget all
logic of contention, charmed out of words, by feasting
on thy orisons, Go on, Jew.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll say ’twas God, not chance, nor fate, that
brought us to wander alone with nature. Read well
nature’s book that lies open in the lap of the Great
Teacher! Only stand close to Him and He will hold
the torch, turn the pages and give the sure interpretations
of the sweetness that feeds quiet, the picturesqueness
which evokes smiles and the stately grandeurs
which beget faith.”</p>

<p>“Israel, thou climbest the sun-ladder to rhapsody!”</p>

<p>“Whether soaring, climbing, or creeping, I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
not; but this I know, I’m tasting in these wanderings
God’s kisses. They are in the flowers; my spirit rests
on His as my body on the balm of the fresh breezes.
Then, animate nature seems so contented and happy!
Why, I’ve been ravished by the songsters; as I’ve said
to myself, they echo the angelic anthem of heaven,
peace. Had any such doubt as haunts thee, come to
me, since passing Jordan, it would have been sung out
of countenance by the winged warblers or dragged
from my heart captive in floral fetters by Him that
hath two staves, beauty and bands.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ichabod, do not pause. Go on, I pray thee.”</p>

<p>“Then thou art glad to hear that nature is not a
beautiful widow mourning her dead bridegroom
through the ages?”</p>

<p>“I love to listen to thee.”</p>

<p>“Listen to a wiser. See those stately heliotropes.
They stand above all of their kind with shining faces;
great in aspiration, great in devotion. All day they
turn toward the sun and when their blossoms fade they
leave a hardy seed. The winter may bury it, but it
springs forth in vernal days, strong in the life it won
by loving the summer sun.”</p>

<p>“Ichabod, I’m charmed! Let’s abide here always
amid these joys of nature.”</p>

<p>“What, be hermits?”</p>

<p>“Yes; life’s troubles are made by its people; the
fewer people the fewer troubles.”</p>

<p>“While sharing their troubles may we not lessen
them. No man may live to himself; we’re wedded to
each other.”</p>

<p>“Yes, wedded to life. A royal phrase; since I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
been constantly either hating or loving it; fearing to
live and then fearing to die. Wedded! ah, ha, ha; the
wedded are those who most madly love and then most
bitterly hate.”</p>

<p>“Say sometimes; then thou’lt be like the stopped
horologue, telling the true time once in twenty-four
hours, at least.”</p>

<p>“Thy poetry runs into caustic quality. What hast
thou been lunching on since morn?”</p>

<p>“At least not on Dead Sea apples, fair without, ashes
within. My poetry, if I have any, always sings in
accord with the company it keeps.”</p>

<p>“How many more arrows in thy quiver, hast thou?”</p>

<p>“Only one, and that a question; does my master intend
to foreswear marriage himself? He ridicules it.”</p>

<p>“I have already done so.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis well thou didst not live in Rome, for its
citizens that dared to live amid the temptations and
soul-crampings of voluntary bachelorhood were highly
taxed for their disregard of the claims of society and
the state.”</p>

<p>“Yet even the Romans ever deemed bachelorhood
a blessing. In this opinion royal Claudius decreed that
the sailors who brought to Rome a ship loaded from
the wheat granaries of Egypt in the time of Agabus’s
famine, should be as a reward permitted to remain unmarried.
If I were a Roman and a sailor I’d pray for
a famine and a Claudius.”</p>

<p>“A world without wives? What a world!”</p>

<p>So saying Ichabod caught up a stick and began
marking on the earth.</p>

<p>“How now, Israel; some sorcery?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“No—yet, may be, yes. I’ll picture a world without
women.”</p>

<p>The Jew outlined the Egyptian deity, “<i>Kneph.</i>”</p>

<p>“What have we, man or beast?”</p>

<p>“Truly, I think partly both. The knight has described
his Elysium and I have here pictured a fit king
for it. Behold thy god, sworn celibate. Egypt’s
adored Kneph. Is this hideous enough?”</p>

<p>“A god! well he’s not handsome; a ram’s head;
four horns; two up, two down; armed as both ram and
goat?”</p>

<p>“Both were sacred to him in Egypt; also the horned
snake with which Cleopatra put out her life; poor, unfortunate
man-wrecked beauty.”</p>

<p>“But, Jew, thou dost dawdle! What of this play?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, only Kneph would do well for a sailor,
at Rome, under Claudius, in famine time!”</p>

<p>“My poet wanders, but yet stings.”</p>

<p>“So? Kneph was a god that boasted, or rather his
spokesmen did, that he was the <i>father of his mother</i>.
What economy! No need to be grateful to or love a
mother; no need to wear a wife on the heart. The
folly of a dark age by folly darkened in the mad attempt
to lift up man without his purer better part.”</p>

<p>“How strange, Jew, whenever we touch a new
belief, or an old one, new to us, we find peoples following
an idea or ideal. There has been a crying
through the world ever for a some one for pilgrim
man to follow. How passing strange; our century
wails the self-same cry; and somehow it always happens
that this matter has something to do with woman.
See; ‘<i>Kneph</i>’ was the monstrous birth of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
thought man superlative, and greatness to be by being
all man. How sharply the devotion to the Madonna
cuts across this! She was mother of the noblest, and
man in the begetting left out. Oh, my head’s full of
thoughts, but they tumble along toward my lips without
system or leader. I talk like a madman, though I
think like a Seraph.”</p>

<p>“I think, Sir Charleroy, that a healthy son of Adam
sneering at all women, publicly, reproaches himself as
being one who never knew a true one.”</p>

<p>“More javelins! I’d swear, anyhow, that if I’d been
Adam, no winged serpent of gaudy colors and honey
tongue could have lured me from Paradise, Eve or no
Eve!”</p>

<p>“If thou hadst been there thou wouldst have been
lonesome with the speechless herds; finding the new
woman, would have loved her like the boy who mates
just to see how it seems.”</p>

<p>“Oh, likely!”</p>

<p>“Then if thy ward or angel attempted to elope
with the devil thou wouldst have gone along, too,
from curiosity, as lad to a hippodrome, just to see the
finish; or as thousands of men since Adam, tied to
wayward women, have gone down with them to darkness,
preferring hell with their idols to heaven without.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Oh, how strangely are the fates of
men and women interwoven.”</p>

<p>“Then thou dost not now elect to live a hermit,
without the companionship of the frail, fair and faithful
sex which are said to double our joys?”</p>

<p>“Yes and multiply our sorrows!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suspect thou’lt change thy late creed very soon.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“I expect ere long that we’ll meet some living blossoms.”</p>

<p>“By my token, that’s good news, Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“So, then, thou art ready to recant?”</p>

<p>Evening came, and the pilgrims supped on the meager
meat they were able to procure in the fields.</p>

<p>“Now poet of the Palm Land mellow my dreams by
possessing me of thy meditations. What fixes thy
gaze?”</p>

<p>“The monarch of the sky; after a day such as this
has been, he seems to me to take his departure with a
peculiar sort of triumphal sweep of his trailing splendors.”</p>

<p>“Horus exulting over prostrate Set.”</p>

<p>“But night, not the green-colored son of Osiris, conquers
now, master.”</p>

<p>“Night never conquers. It merely lives by sufferance;
often routed by the invincible spears of the sun.
Darkness creeps forth here because the golden charger
in masterful strategy has gone elsewhere to rout other
armies of the dark kingdom. Lay this to thy heart,
good Jew.”</p>

<p>“I do, as precious ointment to a blister. Enlarge me.”</p>

<p>“There, Jew; see the fleecy clouds over Jordan.
How grand!”</p>

<p>“Yea, as I’ve often seen them; some like alabaster
thrones, and others like ships on fire, while others are
like silver castles, banded with cornelian and gold, with
here and there hyacinthian shields hung on their battlements,
all fresh as the stones in heaven’s foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
walls! How they career and float along the empurpled
ocean of the west! I forget myself even
now into their midst. Oh, knight, such pictures,
such visions make my soul shout in peals of holy
laughter.”</p>

<p>“My Israel, the sun which woos the earth into making
love to him with flowers never sets in thy brain; thou
livest in the poet’s constant noon.”</p>

<p>“But we both are changing. Even the knight gets
mellow. Hardship, the sun and faith are working in
us both for good.”</p>

<p>“Getting to be? No; thou wert and art poet,
painter and singer; all in one. If the world does not
hear thee the Seraphim will, by and by.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed that souls unbent from some long, twisting
pain, run, aspire and play. It is mercy’s rest, reward.”</p>

<p>“God fits some especially to catch passing joys, Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“Yea, and it all comes from a serene faith that all
is very good as He made it. I’m just opening to the
Sun Eternal, at whose right hand are pleasures evermore.
I love thy wakening touch, my guide.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m a bungling player on the harp of thy soul,
but I love thy melody. Child of nature, speak more
and more to me.”</p>

<p>“I can but ill tell all. I’m dumb amid the waves of
peace which enhalo, the hopes that thrill, the views of
truth that fill my being.”</p>

<p>“I believe thee on my soul, Jew. I’d stop now to
remember a little, perhaps to sleep, since so I can follow
dreams that would craze me to contemplate awake; but
if we now sleep, pray God our day-dreams go on and on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
I think we are pilgrims following spiritual truths.
They’ll lead us on high; let’s not miss their direction.”</p>

<p>“One may sleep, master, when he can not think; for
me, now, I’d rather court, awake, my mind’s guests, for
a time, meanwhile gainsaying the lullabys of cricket
and nightingale now floating out from every bush.”</p>

<p>“So be it. How shall we proceed to pass the time?”</p>

<p>“Can we set up an Ebenezer? God hitherto hath
helped us.”</p>

<p>“I have it; we’ll to the feast.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have what some great kings have not, and
so shall find joy in a feast. We have appetite!”</p>

<p>“Thou dost miss my meaning, though thy point is
prime. We seldom think to thank the Giver for the
power to enjoy as well as for the enjoyable. I knew a
French prince, once, who said he’d give his birthright
for one good dinner, and he was no Esau, either. He
had dinners and dinners, but what were they along
with premature decay gnawing at his vitals like a rat,
while he himself could eat less than a babe?”</p>

<p>“I see; the knight would have us thankfully commemorate
to-day’s enjoyment of nature.”</p>

<p>“Just so; I think, in loving nature, because we begin
to understand her, we will be on our way to all the natural
joy of which she is God’s interpreter.”</p>

<p>“But our feast?”</p>

<p>“The stars are out on the blue; their queen will
soon come up from the sea, then I’ll induct thee into
the feast of the ‘Rose.’ The rose is the queen of
flowers, and flowers the thoughts of God!”</p>

<p>“The feast of the Rose! I’ve heard it was a licencious,
heathen orgy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was then a shameful misnomer. My Mary found
it; transformed it. Out of it, through reverence of her,
comes a beautiful observance. See here, Jew.”</p>

<p>So saying, the knight took from his bosom a string
of precious stones and arranged them, as they glowed
under the moonlight, on the ground heart-shaped.</p>

<p>The knight then questioningly observed the Jew.</p>

<p>The latter shook his head and remarked:</p>

<p>“I’ve seen such often among the Arabs. They have
a prayer for each bead to be said the night after the
death of one of their number, believing the shade departs
not to Hades ’till the prayers are said. Thou
dost not practice their enchantments?”</p>

<p>“Bah! Never. My gemmed circle has a deeper,
holier significance. Each pendant is to recall to mind
some virtue or event in the saintly Mary’s life. Then
there are guilds called, ‘Brothers of the Rosary.’ I
belong to one such; each member is sworn to pray for
all the others wherever scattered. The Turks may
have had a praying string, but the Crusaders have
appropriated and applied it to nobler uses.”</p>

<p>“Tell me more of it, if there be more.”</p>

<p>“There are but fifteen in my brotherhood.”</p>

<p>“Only fifteen, no room for me?” said the Jew.</p>

<p>“Fifteen; to suggest the fifteen great events in
Mary’s life; namely, the <i>Annunciation</i>; Gabriel announced
to Mary that she was to be the Mother of
Jesus; the <i>Visitation</i>; Mary in the Gospel spirit went
quickly to tell her kinswoman of her promised favor; the
<i>Birth of Jesus</i>, this was the crowning joy; then here is the
gem that recalls the <i>Presentation of Jesus</i> in the Temple.
Thou knowest, Jew, thy fathers often wondered how,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
after all, a lamb, an animal, could stand between
offended Deity and man. Jesus in the Temple was
the fulfillment or explanation of the mystery!”</p>

<p>“Yea, truly, I’ve seen this. Oh, that all my people
could also see it!”</p>

<p>“Then, here is the jewel that reminds us of the
‘<i>Scourging at the pillar</i>’ of Him ‘by whose stripes we
are healed.’”</p>

<p>“Israel reads Isaiah with darkened mind, my loving
guide. I’ve seen this. Oh, that my people could.”</p>

<p>“Here is the jewel that recalls the ‘<i>Crowning with
thorns</i>’ of Him that hath to give, at His right hand,
‘pleasures forever more.’ He wore that thorny coronet
that His redeemed should return with singing,
crowned with everlasting joy.”</p>

<p>“I’ve felt it; feel it now. Hallelujah!”</p>

<p>“This one is to commemorate ‘<i>Jesus bearing the
Cross</i>;’ this one ‘<i>His crucifixion</i>,’ and this ‘<i>His resurrection</i>.’”</p>

<p>“The hope of hopes by our Saducees denied!”</p>

<p>“Then we have here another to remind us of our
Saviour’s ‘<i>Ascension</i>,’ with His pregnant promise of a
royal return to take at last His children home.”</p>

<p>“Come, Lord Jesus, even so, quickly!” cried Ichabod.</p>

<p>“‘Wait patiently for Him and He will give thee the
desire of thy heart,’ oh, heir of faithful Abraham!”</p>

<p>“I weary sometimes, my loved teacher.”</p>

<p>“So do we, of our brotherhood; but here is a thought
of rest; this bead recalls ‘<i>Pentecost</i>.’ We are led of
the Spirit, which guides to all truth and comforts by
the way.”</p>

<p>“But what has all this to do with Mary?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, here are two beads; one reminds us of her
‘<i>Assumption</i>’ into heaven, the other of her ‘<i>Crowning</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Was she crowned?”</p>

<p>“Yea, in heaven, for the Son of Mary promised to
His faithful ones this exaltation; ‘<i>I appoint unto you a
Kingdom as my Father hath appointed unto me</i>, ye which
have continued with me in my temptation.’ Surely,
she that followed him from the pains of parturition,
as an outcast, to the Cross and the sepulcher, <span class="smcap">continued</span>!”</p>

<p>“I would I could have been there to enter the race
for such crowning.”</p>

<p>“‘He hath made us kings and priests unto God;
if we suffer we shall also reign with Him,’ Jew.”</p>

<p>“Hallelujah! would I could shout it to heaven; no,
I do; but rather to all Jewry!” exclaimed the Israelite.</p>

<p>“John was only a ‘voice crying in the wilderness,’ as
he thought, but he was heard at the palace and down
the ages. Even now I voice his words in this lone
place.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst not tell me of the meaning of that black
and red pendant,” said Ichabod, interrupting.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>Gethsemane</i>, Jesus, the intercessor for the
world, ‘who ever lives to intercede.’ The black sign
is of that.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve a Saviour in glory praying for me. Oh,
this is balm and water to me! Why do I dare to think of
myself as a poor Jew! God pity; no, forgive me! I, repining
sometimes and yet defended in glory; honored
by royal adoption, elected of God, called to kingship!”</p>

<p>“How we do go up and down; sometimes thou, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
I. Now I’m leading, awhile ago ’twas thou.
Yea, we are all dependants; but this is healthful meditation,
Ichabod, and thy confession rebukes me as well.”</p>

<p>“Is this all of the feast?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Here are some tokens to remind us of
Mary’s life; so brief, so useful. See, here, five gems
that remind us of the wounds of her son; her wounds
as well, for the sword that pierced Him pierced through
to her soul also. At each of these emblems we ‘Rosary
Brothers’ repeat the Lord’s Prayer. Last of all,
reverently clasping this crucifix, we sacredly repeat
the Apostle’s Creed, the same as I taught thee at
Jericho.”</p>

<p>“I remember, as I do the water courses, when thirsty.”</p>

<p>“What think’st thou of all this formality? Is it like
the Arabic mummeries?”</p>

<p>“No, they are mocking devils, are they not?”</p>

<p>“I am not to judge of their sincerity, nor their needs,
nor art thou.”</p>

<p>“Master, I wish I could be a Rosary Brother. Methinks
it would help my ambling faith sometimes, if I
could touch a token.”</p>

<p>“He above is all tender of baby faiths that can do
no better than amble. Remember the words of thy
own Hosea: ‘I drew them with cords of a man, with
bonds of love, I taught Ephriam to go; taking them
by the arms; just as a mother teaches her babe to walk,’
is it not?”</p>

<p>“Even so. Does the Rosary help some to walk?”</p>

<p>“I believe it does.”</p>

<p>“Tell me more about it.”</p>

<p>“The Crusaders were the first to call Mary ‘The Rose.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
To almost all mankind that flower has ever been the
emblem of pure, unselfish love, and when the soldiers
of the Cross grew to understand the character of her
that gave the world its Saviour, they could think of no
title more fitting for that queenly woman.”</p>

<p>“I’ve an Egyptian rosary, knight. See, I wear it
on this golden chain, next my heart, for its safety——”</p>

<p>“To ward off witchcraft?”</p>

<p>“Bah! ’Tis a toy in usefulness. I keep it, thinking
it may work incantation with the money-lender,
and so save me sometime from starvation.” Then the
Jew laughed aloud at his own wit. It seemed very
ridiculous to him to liken his talisman to the real
rosary or its saint.</p>

<p>“Wouldst thou let me examine it, Jew?”</p>

<p>The latter handed to the knight a chain and image.</p>

<p>“Egyptian?”</p>

<p>“An image of Neb-ta, sister of Isis, the wife of the
Sun God Osiris. It was given me by a Copt priest,
whom I saved from drowning in the Nile.”</p>

<p>“A Copt?”</p>

<p>“A Copt. He was a professed Christian; but, like
some of the ancestral Egyptians, sought to be right by
being a little of every thing. He was very superstitious,
though he thought himself very broad-minded.
He was quite certain that Coptic Christianity was true,
though not equally certain that his pagan ancestors
were in faith all false. He thought he’d be on the safe
side by mixing a little of all creeds with his own, and
so he prayed in Christ’s name and also Neb-ta’s.”</p>

<p>“A pretty fool, Jew.”</p>

<p>“Yea. He had a story about the goddess, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pretty when not absurd, running somehow thus: When
Osiris was cut to pieces by Set, a type of day slain by
night, I think, Neb-ta went round the world with her
widowed sister, Isis, to gather up the fragments of her
spouse. Isis is the moon above; below, reproduction.
She is pictured in Egypt, as all the female deities, with
two eggs and a half-circle at the side, to express the
latter idea. Isis has in her hand also this sign—a
cross supporting an egg, to typify immortality. The
old Egyptian priest told me this sympathetic Neb-ta,
if I trusted her, would reward me for saving his life, by
defending my case in Hades. There is a good deal of
mysticism in all this, but I rather prize the gift, since
it reminds me that I once saved a man.”</p>

<p>“But, Nourahmal? Since thou knew of Mary thou
hast saved a woman, Jew.”</p>

<p>The Jew was silent. The knight continued:</p>

<p>“These philosophic, inseeing, sign-writing, symbol-making
Egyptians were pilgrims, too; a nation of
graal-seekers; after an idea, example. I see always the
huge Sphinx coming before me when I think of
them.”</p>

<p>“The Sphinx! Well, that’s strange. I’d never think
of that, unless I happened upon something very big
and very meaningless!”</p>

<p>“No, no; the people that rocked the cradle of religions
in their infancy, wrought all their theology into
that one mighty symbol, to endure and challenge compare
with all that man should find beside.”</p>

<p>“I do not see how!”</p>

<p>“The Sphinx faces the East—light!”</p>

<p>“True!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“It can not reach that light toward which it looks,
neither could the Nubians.”</p>

<p>“All true.”</p>

<p>“It was part man, part beast; but the upper part
was man, and this is what we think we know, and all
of man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, knight, Phthah, the ‘beautiful-faced,’ ‘secret-opener’
of the Nile gods has touched thee.”</p>

<p>“The Sphinx was like man’s thought; too great for
words; at least such words as men can now fit to their
lips.”</p>

<p>“I see; it’s all coming into my mind, master.”</p>

<p>“It sat still and was silent, but the world went on;
the thought it expressed reached hearts after the men
that formed the image had passed away. The truth
lives ever, and can not die until it completes its purpose.”</p>

<p>“Thou art a magician, who pleases, astonishes,
excites, instructs, and at the same time plays with
me as if I were a pigmy!”</p>

<p>“It’s not I, but the truth. The Sphinx again! Its
hugeness, truth expressed, appears mighty when placed
by our sides.”</p>

<p>“Tell me where I am! Shall I fling Neb-ta away as
a bauble, or beg its pardon for hanging so much meaning
to a fool’s neck?”</p>

<p>“Vehement! The sun is in thy head!”</p>

<p>“But shall I sit and look as a Sphinx, or run mad
because I can’t?”</p>

<p>“Be calm, and let me tell thee that the dwellers by
the mighty Nile plagued themselves with lasting darkness
when they banished the people whose leader’s face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
shone from communion with Jehovah. They clung to
some half truths, left them by the progeny of Joseph,
but the half was dimmed by courted lusts.”</p>

<p>“But my people had no Neb-ta, no women divinities
to leave in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“No, yet Egypt, aiming to exalt the tender, the beautiful,
the mother, incarnated certain virtues, and lo, a
woman deity! It was an effort to find the ‘Rose.’
The nation was in a vast, serious pilgrimage through all
their dynasties after an idea, a pattern; an opportunity
to reach and to express the best things. I tell thee,
Jew, the heathen nations sit in darkness; this side
and that, along the track of time, holding here and
there a torch, waiting through the night whose hours
are tolled off at century intervals, for something, Some
One. There have passed before them like phantoms,
gods and gods; man invented, man evolved; but none
of these tarried, none satisfied. Oh, ‘the Isles wait for
thee,’ Jesus, Thou Ideal Man, and also for the true conception
of Mary the ideal woman!”</p>

<p>“For two Gods? Is Mary divine?”</p>

<p>“Did I say that? Nay, as the child Jesus was subject
to her, so she was subject to the Christ, at
last. Christ was the Word, Mary His blessed echo;
Christ the Sun, Mary the Moon that reflected that
light, showing its beauty in woman’s life!”</p>

<p>“But now, what shall I do with my beautiful fright,
Neb-ta, Sir Charleroy?”</p>

<p>“Put her away, in mind, amid the galaxies of
woman deities; mythical in all but the pitiful sincerity
of the adoration of their devotees and in the greatness
of the truths they vaguely articulated. See, I’ll interpret:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Isis going round the world to gather up the
fragments of her dismembered husband. Woman’s
ministry; the restoration of man; wife consecration to
an only love. Then there was not only beautiful widowhood,
second only to beautiful wifehood, but also
the spinster sister. Hail Egypt! Thy Sphinx saw
further than our peoples of boasted civilizations. At
our best we never rose so near to a just altitude as to
attempt the deification of the maiden sister, the omnipresent
angel, who mothers other people’s children as
if they were her own. Egypt worshipped motherhood,
perhaps grossly, in adoring the earth’s fructifications,
but she did not overlook those pious souls who
in a glorious self-abnegation play waiting-maids to the
real queens of earth, the child-bearers. I’d never
tire praising the child-bearers, or all who love them,
for they that bring forth a life are greater than the
greatest kingly man-slayer on earth. The world is
upside down; no religion is wholly false that aids to
right it in any degree. Hail, creeds of Egypt, or any
other land, that seek to efface from fame’s pages the
names of life-destroyers that thereon may chiefly
shine the names of those who give or save life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oscillating Sir Charleroy, thou art just and
courtly now.”</p>

<p>“Praise me, then! Mankind would average better
by far than it does if all were right half the time.”</p>

<p>“Would I could gather all the threads of to-day’s
blessed communings into a golden band to support
over my heart faith’s breastplate.”</p>

<p>“I can give thee its summary: God, a beauty Creator,
out of all things hideous in His good Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
will emerge the fine, tender and loving. Neb-ta, Egypt’s
ideal, carried the lotus, the flower of unrestrained
pleasure, as her scepter; Neb-ta-like the influences
that sway most human hearts to-day; but the Rose of
the world has blossomed. Mary, the flower of women.
They that love and serve, as that warm, red-hearted
woman, shall at last reign in eternal bliss within the
ruby walls of the New Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“I’m with the knight, to proclaim thy Rose!”</p>

<p>“A good profession! It will be well if we remember
that woman is as essential to religion as religion to
women. As for man he needs the one as the interpreter
of the other. Therefore, it was that God sent
to earth a flower that could talk.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">The Israelites, along Jabbock, were all aglow
with preparation for celebrating one of
their feasts. Sir Charleroy and his comrade
journeying along, in the early morning,
were apprised of the advent of the festivities
by the passing near them of a company of maidens,
marching and chanting. The pilgrims drew apart and
sequestered themselves behind a clump of nubt trees
that they might observe, themselves unobserved, the
graceful procession of singers.</p>

<p>“Well, my poet, didst thou conjure up these fairies,
or have we come on the musk-born houri?” Sir Charleroy
spoke in an absent-minded manner, perhaps, with
an affectation of a lack of very much interest. In fact,
long privation of the presence of women had somehow
rusted from his bearing, in their vicinage, most of the
confident courtier. In a word, he was now bashful in
their presence. He spoke with a small witticism to subdue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
his own embarrassment. His words were unheard,
for the Jew was all engaged in contemplating the
passing women.</p>

<p>In truth, the latter made a striking picture; garbed
as they were, in holiday attire; all young, oriental in
beauty, and fresh in face, form and action. They were
rural maidens and that says all. It had been a long
time since either Ichabod or Sir Charleroy had met
such types of womanhood; all free from affectation;
all natural and graceful in motion; a band of women,
as sisters, bent to one purpose and that a lofty one,
the proper observance of a joyous, pious, religious ceremonial.</p>

<p>Presently Ichabod drew a long breath and rapturously
exclaimed: “Praise be to the Patriarchs, my
people!”</p>

<p>“I’d rather say, Ichabod, praise the Patriarch’s
daughters, if these be human!”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! flesh, indeed! Our Hebrew maidens celebrating
the Feast of Esther!”</p>

<p>“Are they praying God for Adams, so that each
Esther and Vashti may have one all to herself? If so,
we are part answers to their prayers.”</p>

<p>“Hush such jest! These be holy maidens, now honoring
our Esther. Thou knowest about her?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; she was my heroine before Our Lady
dethroned in my heart all others. I was wont to wish
I’d been about in Haman’s time. I’d have aroused
that old dotard, Ahasuerus, right quickly. By the
sackcloth of Mordecai, if I’d been the king, the
hanging would have put the Haman family into
mourning long before it did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, how like angels! It’s years since I saw a woman
other than as deflowered by harem life. Heavens,
what a spoiler man is at his worst!”</p>

<p>“Dost forget Nourahmal? But no matter; I admire,
and wonder that some roving band of Arabs, with
less piety, or more force than we, does not swoop down
upon these innocents for seraglio prizes. Perhaps
these have the liveried angels about, that are said ever
to guard saintly purity.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless; and besides them, with all the practical
providence which belongs to the Jew, thou mayst be
sure that the groves, not far away, are full of fathers,
brothers, lovers.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were a brother to some of them.”</p>

<p>“Then thou’dst be a Jew.”</p>

<p>“I’d forget that in being a lover to the others.”</p>

<p>“Thou wouldst not change thy faith for a woman?”</p>

<p>“Now, I’d swear I would not. If like most men,
and in love, I’d swear I would; and then, having gotten
my new priestess, in a little while, backslide and drag
her with me, or make her heart weep. My comfort in
the last estate being my consistency, if not my constancy.
What a mad rout it is when religion and love,
born twins, cross purposes?”</p>

<p>“That’s a very true, yet bitter speech. I’ll tell the
Hebrew maidens to beware.”</p>

<p>“Better tell me to beware, now. It’s the beginning
that makes the trouble. No beginning, then no after
folly.”</p>

<p>The procession glided past and the pilgrims followed
at a distance.</p>

<p>“We are within an arm of dear old Jabbock,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Ichabod, as they came to a river-bank, later.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! my chartless pilot, does the current whisper
its name to thee, in Hebrew? I’d not wonder if it
did, since every thing is clannish in this country.—I
hope there is no more swimming for us to do.”</p>

<p>“Its tumbling waters are full of voices to me, blending
with echoes of things of the past; but one who
spoke a thousand times more tenderly than ever spoke
murmuring waters, told me its name, knight.”</p>

<p>“Nourahmal? No! rather some one of those pious
beauties we passed not long ago. Oh, roguish Ichabod,
I remember thou wert away a long time in the
morning after our breakfast of peas and grapes. But,
dear Ichabod,” continued Sir Charleroy, feigning
rebuke, “didst thou so soon forget thy little convert
of Jericho? I wonder if thou lifted up thy voice
and wept when thou kissed the maid that told thee
the river’s name? Come, confess, and I’ll call thee
Isaac.”</p>

<p>“Raillery of prime quality, knight; but raillery and
ridicule, though keenly pointed, are generally bad arrows
for long range.”</p>

<p>“Well, no matter. I’m glad thou knowest the place,
if thou dost know it. Who told thee the name of this
water?”</p>

<p>“One with a voice to me sweeter, kinder than that
of any betrothed lover’s ever can be.”</p>

<p>“Very, very eloquent thou art. Indeed, if we were
in Italy, I’d guess ’twas a syren had communed with
thee; in France, a Crusader troubadour; in Rhineland,
the water sprite, Lurline; but, being in this wondrous
country of revelations, apparitions, prophets, angels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and the like, I can only as a catechumen, ask thy dulcet
informer’s name?”</p>

<p>“How oddly thou dost talk when thou talkest as a
double man; half sneering infidel; half Christian
preacher.”</p>

<p>“A truce, Ichabod. That may be a home-thrust well
aimed, but it’s enough that one of us be bitter. It’s
sometimes natural to me, but not to thee.”</p>

<p>“A bee-sting will redden the high priest’s brow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll not sting thee. Who gave the name of
the river?”</p>

<p>“Master, one to me alone of all the world an angel,
my mother. I was born near here, and the memories
of a youth made happy by one all patient, all loving,
rises above and survives all changes.”</p>

<p>“My noble friend, forgive my repartee. I’m glad,
truly, that we are so lucky as to have this knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Lucky? Then all is not fate; there is some chance,
if no Providence?”</p>

<p>“Pardon more; the bee-sting is still on thy brow.
Ichabod, I can not help my feelings, which sometimes
make me think that only God can tread the hidden,
narrow line between stern fate and happy accident.
They say the Sybil wrote her prophetic decrees upon
leaves and flung them recklessly to the inconstant
winds. Just so we’re in decreed courses, swirled by
chance gusts.”</p>

<p>“Yet we two are getting on well together.”</p>

<p>“So do chance and fate; the pity is to the waif that
falls between them.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how here, in Holy Land, thou canst think
of any control but Providence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wonder? So do I. I’m a bundle of wonderings.”</p>

<p>“Listen to Jabbock.”</p>

<p>“I do, more attentively than Jabbock to me. What
of it?”</p>

<p>“Grander rivers are forgotten; why is it so remembered?”</p>

<p>“We’re forgotten, meaner men remembered.”</p>

<p>“This river sings through the centuries of history
the song of a fugitive of pale heart, who in sheer
desperation, long, long ago, seized a fleeting hope and
became a prince, having power to prevail with God.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Jacob, who worked fourteen years to win a
woman. It was, I’m sure, the woman that nerved him
to attempt greatness. Such a woman! Had she been
like our moderns she would have jilted him, or eloped
with him, before the end of one of the fourteen years.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not tilt with thy sarcasms. It were much better
to remember that he, a pigmy, the night in his soul,
as that about him, black as Erebus, grappled with the
mighty, unknown, unseen apparition to find he was
holding Deity. The mysteries of crossing fates and
chances are as open nut-bur compared to that of all
weakness prevailing with Omnipotence, my good master,
I think.”</p>

<p>“But ever after that joust, Jacob was a cripple!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but remember, as he halted on his thigh the
sun rose over Penuel, ‘the place of seeing God,’ by interpretation.
He was stronger for his laming!”</p>

<p>“A very ‘Timor-lame,’ this prince of great chances
and mean ways.”</p>

<p>“Time and trial repaired Jacob’s spotted soul.”</p>

<p>“There was much room for the mending, I do vow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“His weightings bespeak some charity. Think; a
weak mother, one designing wife, and plenty of wealth!”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis true, these were enough to have undone
St. Anthony, if the devil had only thought to have tried
them all at once upon him!”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy swings back to his old bitterness toward
women; did he never love one?”</p>

<p>“No, not as a lover. I was never tried except by
designing coquetries that nauseated finally.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, like most solitary men, thou so revered
thyself by habit that there was no room for other person
in thy heart.”</p>

<p>“I never met one I deemed perfect and available.”</p>

<p>“Better to have loved some one far from perfect
than none. If thy heart-fount had been once touched
it would have set thy imaginations to weaving halos
about the one touching. Thou wouldst have enthroned
her by a love that would have transformed both. She
would have become in time what she was in love’s
young dream; while thou wouldst have grown by the
experience to be twice the man thou hadst been—or
art.”</p>

<p>“The sun in thy head is settling down into thy
heart, Jew.”</p>

<p>“Is that so, Charleroy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not to harm; heart sunsets ripen heart
fruits; that’s the reason the autumn suns run low; the
low suns ripen. But after all, I’m not so very miserable
in heart. I’ve loved some women; mother and my
Mary——”</p>

<p>“Filial love, religious love! somewhat akin and
blessing him that feels their mellow, exalting influences;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
but, oh, Sir Charleroy, they do not fill completely the
heart’s temple. There are places there for the expression
of ruddy, glorious lover’s love. The three make
up an all-comprehending trinity, and fill the man as
Deity the universe. I see religious love in adoration of
God’s Fatherhood, mother love in the tender leading
of the Spirit, lover’s love in the priceless self-surrender
of our Saviour. That made the angels sing, and in
the being of each of our race there is room, aye need,
of the melody which only the experiencing of this passion
in full can produce. In love-mating is a wondrous
thrill which can be but faintly voiced even by
those who have experienced it.</p>

<p>“There are other passions which ebb with time, or,
being well fed, wax gross; not so with this one. Inspired
by the potencies of life, which lie at the very
core of being, it wells up in rills, rivers and torrents of
pleasurable sensations. Out from the heart it goes to
the remotest members, only to double on its courses
and dash again through the beating heart, heating
its flame by its doubling and hasting, making the
beatings wilder by its hastings, and then hasting more
because of the wilder beatings. Of all emotions love
is the most tireless. It increases by giving, grows
stronger by action and proclaims the secret of its heavenly
birth, its immortality, by the way in which it
deepens and ripens with every movement of its life.
Aye, more, it proclaims itself the power of the resurrection
by the way it transforms the lives it possesses.
A man may be a lout, ever so crude in fiber, but this
musical flame passing through his being, burns up his
dross, making him all brave, courteous, tender, poetic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
religious! Yea, religious! If it do not utterly redeem
a sinner possessed by it, it will take him nearer to salvation
than any other power known on earth, except
the Spirit of Grace. It is as the opening of the eyes
of the blind man, for it opens the doors of a new sense
to the realizing of a world as new as delightful. As
the thrummings on the harp-strings someway leave
a lasting sonorousness and tenderness in the supporting
woods about the lyre, so leaves this passion,
through the beatings of every wave of it, wealth. Its
devotee by it is inducted into exhaustless new realms
and possessions, unalterably secured to him, and at
the same time beyond all computation. He ever gathers
treasures, as a prince from incoming fleets, and is
made affluent beyond all counting. He surpasses all
in wealth-getting, and yet is infinitely apart from the
littleness of avarice. It is to him the advent of charity’s
full-orbed day. It may be fancy in him, but it’s to
him very real; the world about, as if having learned his
secret, seems to be dressing for the wedding feast,
while all things appear to be coming very confidentially
to him to whisper the divine mandate, ‘marry and multiply.’
He is trusted, yet trusts; leads, yet follows. He
is proud to display, a little, his conquest, but does so
with a sort of alert charming selfishness, which gives
notice to the world that he alone is to wear the chosen
one upon his heart. He realizes the paradox of giving
all and receiving all; the mystery of two lives merged
into one by an utter surrender, each to each, which
leaves both infinitely richer than the sum of all their
ownings could make either if possessed by the one
apart from the other. Oh, how almost imperiously each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
demands that the other shall surrender all and then
how great the joy each feels in leading the chosen mate
to surprises at the munificence and completeness of the
giving up of all by the one who just now demanded all.
I do not know the woman’s heart, but can readily believe
it far surpasses the man’s in its consecration, enjoyment
and aspiring. I know the man’s, but my
words are ragged in description. I know that this
grand passion makes him wondrously weak and wondrously
strong. Sometimes these inner feelings come
nigh overwhelming him; sometimes they fall upon his
life like the musical ebb-waves on resonant shores. I
can not word it all, nor is it strange, since I am speaking
of a life of heavenly flights, and best expressed by
voiceless signs, embraces. In love’s hour the man realizes,
as never before, his lordliness and his pride and
ambition are fed by a growing conviction that all
the world is small beside himself and his; proud as a
conqueror of untold wealth, he yields to the tender
ties that unrelentingly bind him and crucifies his native
roughness that he may be more like, more worthy her
he rules and obeys. He is made finer; she stronger.
Has she virtues, he appropriates them; at the same time,
by the homage implied by his appropriation, makes
them to shine more brightly on the brow and heart
of his queen. He touches the fires on the altar she has
erected within herself to love alone, and the altar-fires
blaze until her whole being is illuminated as a temple on
fête days. She puts on his best parts, and then he revels
in delight as he beholds his virtues refined and so
beautifully framed. There are times when, like a mighty
anthem, his passion passes over and through him. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
is he nigh to madness, being in the mood to slay himself,
or another doing aught to check the rapture of the
mighty swellings of the music that pours over every
nerve from head to heart, to limb. Then it is he embraces
and kisses and embraces again; as an inspired
artist of music, exhausting himself to prolong this joy,
almost materialized. Indeed, I saw one who said ‘this
is tangible music. I feel it; taste it; see it!’ It seems
to thicken the air until I rise unwinged, and yet in a
flight that seems to me as free and brilliant as that of
the golden oriole’s. If the enchanted enchanter be
pure and true, she leads her captive king, made tender
and yet more manly by his captivity, surely upward from
tumultuous passion’s sway to the ambrosial table-lands of
higher affection where both may reign tenderly, bravely,
hopefully, forever. I tell thee, knight, the finest spectacle
on earth is a man in his prime, creation’s lord at
his best, sincerely, completely in love with a queenly
woman. Next after getting God into a man’s heart,
the greatest blessing is the getting of a woman of genuine
parts therein.”</p>

<p>“Oh, child of the sunny palm land, thou hast imbibed
wondrous eloquence. But thou sayest truly. Now, for
the women that are so to queen us men. No woman
that I ever knew of could so intoxicate, transform and
translate me.”</p>

<p>“One like Eve, the gift of God?”</p>

<p>“The first woman, like the first man, was pure without
virtue, until tried; then she fell. I think of her
chiefly as being a splendid animal, yet, as Adam was
not left for man’s example, neither was she. I still think
Eve passed by in history to be only what she was full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
proof that love which rises no higher than to give all
to and for that which was like the fruit of the tempting
tree, good for food and pleasant to the eyes, is not like
the love that at last hung on the tree of Calvary. Oh,
child of Abraham, I hear the ‘<i>voice of God walking in
the garden in the cool of the day</i>,’ saying to a world of
flitting, false ideals, and those yearning for pilots and
patterns, ‘<i>Where art thou?</i>’ I don’t know, for one,
exactly where I am, but I’m going forward and upward
someway.”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy thou dost dazzle me by thy correspondences
and insights, if I do thee by my pictures.
We are quits.”</p>

<p>“But we’ll not quit. This pilgrim idleness has value.
I never knew what I believed until, thus flung out of
life’s hurly burly, I had little company but my thoughts.
There was method of reason in God’s taking His prophets
to lone places, to fit them for understanding the
rapturing visions with which He filled them.”</p>

<p>“’Tis so, true; but what thinks the knight of Esther,
the beautiful Queen? She’s the idol and ideal in
Israel in all times and places.”</p>

<p>“Wondrous woman! A girl, petted, ill-trained, from
poverty suddenly exalted, surrounded by the skilled
intriguants of court, a jealous, exacting, conceited,
harem-demoralized old king for a spouse, she was then
burdened with the salvation of a nation. I’ve so pitied
her that I’ve forgotten to admire how well she did in
her trying lot.”</p>

<p>“Can the world ever have a finer figure or presentment
of all that is womanly? I do not challenge thy
Mary, but may I not put the two side by side?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Israel has two great women in their way. The
one, Esther, exemplifying all sweetness and the mild
strength of a suddenly developed woman, doing grandly
in one emergency when great peril and great love
aroused her from only being an entrancing, petted
beauty, to be the heroine of an hour. But she was not
tried by the searching test of a lifetime. She never
meets the needs of mothers seeking an ideal. Rizpah,
your other grand woman, was the mother, even the
mother of sorrows, of the Old Testament. It takes
these two to make an ideal, and yet the pattern is
incomplete. God walks yet in the garden where men
live, with only these two before them, and ever and
anon they hear the unanswerable, ‘<i>Where art thou?</i>’”</p>

<p>“Why, my mentor, master, thou hast touched our
Scriptures with the rod that budded; the whole opens
to me as if for the first time. Methinks, if I were permitted
to lay hands now upon one of our sacred volumes,
I’d be fairly overcome by the light that would break
out on me from within it.”</p>

<p>“‘The entrance of the word giveth light,’ Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“I’m moved, master, along lines I can not turn from,
to the one woman of all, Mary. She is thy ideal
queen of hearts?”</p>

<p>“I’m a pilgrim and follow her, seeing none better.”</p>

<p>“Then thou wouldst be willing to wed such as Mary?”</p>

<p>“Hold! This is sacrilegious! I’ll not think of
Mary in any such comparison. Leave my patron saint
upon her high pedestal. I save her for my soul’s health,
as every man should save some noble woman, for an
inner enshrining, to be all that woman may be at her
best, his beloved, his inspirer, and yet touching no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
spring of his life save such as responds to things of
moral grandeur.”</p>

<p>“Ah, master, I’ve not yet been enamored fully of
this woman. I feel a stranger to her, but I feel the
meaning of the finer things thou hast just spoken. I
have the need of which thou dost speak, and my life,
like a babe, often now goes out crying, ‘Mother,
mother.’ As we lay, yesterday night, beneath the
quiet firmament, I gazed up and asked a sign of God
in prayer. It was a baby cry I know, but I saw one
star that staid and staid above me. It seemed to be
warmed with reddish tintings, and I thought that its
glitterings were proof that it was taking part in some
anthem of the morning stars. Then I dreamed that
my mother was in the star all luminous, holy, happy,
looking down in constant guardianship of her outcast
boy! Oh, can a child ever be outcast utterly to
mother? Can it be that she, who so loved me and so
loved God, can hate me now, loving her and loving God
as I do? God knows my heart! Will he not tell her
all? Her constant mandate to me was, ‘keep a loyal
heart, an undefiled conscience.’ I’ve tried to do both,
but then her soul loathed apostacy. Does she loathe
me for leaving Israel’s fold? My heart all torn, cries
to-day, ‘Mother, mother!’ I’m sure she can not hate
me. To-morrow I hope I shall pray at her grave.”</p>

<p>Then the vehement Israelite fell on the ground in
an ecstasy, utterly unconscious of his companion, and,
kissing the earth as if already he was by that parent’s
resting place, wildly called, “Mother! my mamma!
oh, I’m so lonely, so unhappy! Let me come! God,
God, let me go to mother! Mother, I did it as thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
saidst. I’m no leper. I’m not a heretic! I love thee.
I love God. I’ve kept pure. I’ve trusted God’s care
in all my trouble. Mamma, my mamma, let Ichabod
embrace thee!” Exhausted and quivering he there lay.
The knight was silent. It was holy ground, and the
whole thicket about seemed to be glowing with the fire
that burns without consuming.</p>

<p>The travelers were encamped again under the sky,
and it was now night. A shooting star sped through
the constellation of Orion and fell down toward the
Dead Sea.</p>

<p>“An omen, Jew.”</p>

<p>“Explain, brother knight.”</p>

<p>“Life; bright, short, ending in gloom.”</p>

<p>“Look at the fixed stars.”</p>

<p>“They preach fate.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but they have the majority. Few fall; I
think, too, Someone holds them.”</p>

<p>“Thy hopefulness colors thy faith.”</p>

<p>“Thy murmurings run toward final madness, knight;
the Rabbis, good men, so taught me.”</p>

<p>“If one star falls may not all? If Providence hold
them, why does one escape?”</p>

<p>“Thou hast heard that the giant Orion having lost his
eyes, afterward regained his sight by turning his
sockets toward the rising sun; that meteor we saw shot
through the constellation Orion. Look up.”</p>

<p>“A happy simile and pungent thrust, Jew.”</p>

<p>“He that sent the lightnings to show us our way
out of dread Jericho, most likely now commissioned
some angel to swing a meteor across the sky as a
torch or beacon for our guidance. The trail of flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
teaches me that God is writing His royal signature on
some great message.”</p>

<p>“This world is too vast and too thronged with insignificants,
such as we, for such especial carings on
God’s part. There are too many kings, too many
shepherds, too many follies for Him to constantly
watch any one or two.”</p>

<p>“Backward, forward; now good, now bad. What a
charging, changing knight! Pray God to get thee
right and then fix thee.”</p>

<p>Their converse was interrupted by a prolonged
trumpet blast, echoing from hill to hill. Sir Charleroy
sprang to his feet and clasping his sword hilt, cried
eagerly, “We’re ambuscaded!”</p>

<p>“No, by the glory of God, ’twas the temple call!
How grand it sounds away in this wilderness!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Jew, I’ve heard that call; this one had six
responses.”</p>

<p>“’Twas echo’s magic! Didst thou not notice how
the sound spread as it traveled in a sort of sheet
of melody? Then it rose and fell from low hill
to high. One blast; seven responses. Nature proclaiming
against fate and chance; the covenant number.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so confident that it’s a miracle; what if it
were some Mamelukes or Druses, planning one of
their pious immolations of heretics with us for the
victims?”</p>

<p>“Nay, brother, It’s ‘<i>Purim</i>’; that feast is now due,
and always begins at early starlight. I know it.
Come, I’ll put it to the proof.”</p>

<p>“Hold; poets are more rash than knights in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
charge, but not so skillful in retreat! Whither wouldst
thou?”</p>

<p>“I’ll spy out the trumpeters and report.”</p>

<p>“Not alone. I’ll go, too. This camp will care for
itself if they beyond be friends; if enemies, why then,
without consulting us, they will care for all we have.
But this,” said the knight, toying with his sword,
“was blessed by a priest to preach to infidels.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FEAST OF PURIM.</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Stealthily Ichabod, followed by Sir
Charleroy, approached the place from
which the trumpet call had sounded. The
foliage was dense, the necessary way somewhat
winding, and these circumstances, together with
the fact that it was expedient to move with great
caution, made the progress of the explorers very slow.
The last ray of day had faded, sung away by the evening
bird and insect chorusers, whose concert strains,
like the vanishing notes of æolian harps swept by
dying breezes, were now blending, without a line to
mark the place of transition, into the lull of the night.
Nature’s lullaby to tired, drowsy life. It was a witching
hour in the woods, and the scene that lay just
beyond the pilgrims in an opening by Jabbock was an
enchantment. The river, reflecting the moon rays and
the lights of torches borne by many intermingling
feasters, flowed silently along like a stream of mingled
silver and fire, while tree and shrub along its sides, as
green as green could be, bore as fruits lights of many
colors. In the opening, surrounded by beacons, banners
and the lamp-bearing trees, the beauty as well as
the center of all was a magnificent patriarchal tent,
made of costly materials. About the pavilion were
mounds of earth, elevated upon high tripods, seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in all, in symbols of the seven temple candle-sticks.
On each mound there blazed a fire fed by resinous faggots,
and the lights of the fires falling upon the folds
of the tent, caught up here and there by bands of blue
and gold, made the whole glisten like jeweled silk.</p>

<p>“Hallelujah,” with suppressed joy, exclaimed Ichabod,
“the tabernacle of God with men!”</p>

<p>“Hush, rash man, and watch!” rebukingly replied
Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“Watch? Why, my soul is in my eyes. I’m as
one famished for years smelling a feast!”</p>

<p>As they looked on the beautiful scene, they perceived
that the front of the pavilion was lifted up and
stretched forward as a canopy over an altar, richly
decorated with twined olive branches and blood-red
blossoms. A little way off, and yet partly encircling
the altar, were little walnut trees, each tree having on
its branches glistening lamps, half hidden by wreaths of
hollyhocks and asters.</p>

<p>The moon sank behind the hills; the night darkened,
but the fires and lamps burned still more
brightly.</p>

<p>“It’s like fairy-land, Jew,” after little, spake Sir
Charleroy.</p>

<p>“More beautiful, knight. Wait and see.”</p>

<p>There was a burst of music, instantly followed by
the entrance of youths and old men; some singing,
others vigorously playing ugabs, reed-flutes, and tambourines.
Somewhere near, though unseen by the
watchers, were happy women; they recognized their
voices in refrains, choruses, and merry peals of laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, this is not warlike, but what is it, Jew?”
queried Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait a little.”</p>

<p>There came a commanding trumpet blast. Its tones
died away in the melody-waves of a score of viols,
managed by unperceived musicians. Then silence;
presently the huge blue curtain that hung across the
tent, just back of the outstretching front canopy, parted,
and there emerged an aged man of stately form, wearing
an Aaronic mitre and priestly robes; rich as well as
ample. He paused before the altar a moment, as if in
prayer, and then suddenly the air far and wide
quivered with a sound like a cyclone hail. There were
also cornet blasts mingling therewith.</p>

<p>“Heavens, Jew, explain!”</p>

<p>“Selah! These the drums and waking clappers; the
signal to be given. Now for ‘Purim’ in earnest.”</p>

<p>The groves about seemed to be alive and moving,
for from every direction toward the center gathered
men and boys, bearing palm branches and torches;
these, as they advanced, moved with speeded pace,
presently they were in a perfect maze, the music of
every kind growing louder and louder, then seeming to
die away.</p>

<p>“They’re carrying the edicts of Ahasuerus to the
Jews to defend themselves, master.”</p>

<p>“A fine play, Jew!”</p>

<p>Now the blue curtain parted again, and from the
pavilion emerged another stately form, in all except that
he lacked priestly robing, the very counterpart of the
aged man first at the altar.</p>

<p>“Glory to Shaddah! again I see the holy brothers,
Harrimai,” cried Ichabod.</p>

<p>The second patriarch motioned silence; all in the
assembly bent their heads in breathless attention and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the patriarch spoke: “Brethren of Israel, hearken and
give God all the glory who this hour permits us, His
chosen people, to celebrate in peace, with joy, our
glad Purim feast. This day, Jehovah granted me the
most wholesome comfort of hearing from a pashaw of
our scourge that the last of the armies of the Moslem,
beaten by want and internal discord, were melting out
of our land like fog banks before the rising sun. He
certified to me for a handful of barley (for which he
had come to stand in need) that those hated cross-bearing
invaders, the knights, were gone, never to return.
So God has worked in our behalf as in the days
of Esther, setting our enemies to destroying one another
and then compassing the slinging out of His holy
places, the abominable remnants. So may His thunders,
as of old, forever beat on the heads of all who lift
themselves against our Israel!”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of applause; first like the buzz
of the noonday insects of the groves, then like a careering
hurricane. The applause swelled up, drowning
all sounds, causing the fires to flicker and flame, making
the pavilion’s sides sway and wave as if all were
feeling the joy present. The musical instruments
quickly now caught up the strain of the cheery voices,
and all was in a perfect whirl of excitement with one
thought, ‘praise.’ It was free and fluent, because it
came from hearts practiced in the ultimate swings
from joy to sorrow and then from sorrow to joy. For
half an hour nearly, the rhapsody continued, nor did it
temperate until sheer exhaustion fell on the revelers.</p>

<p>Presently, after an interval of comparative quiet,
there came a flourish of cornets and a roar of the rattling
clappers. It was a signal followed by the uplifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of the old priest’s hands as if in benediction. All
heads were bowed; some of the congregation knelt,
and then he spoke in sonorous, yet soothing voice,
words of benediction: “Blessed art thou, Oh Lord
our God, King of the Universe, who hath wrought all
miracles for our fathers and also for us, at this time.”</p>

<p>Then the people stood up, and the second patriarch,
advancing to the front of the altar, began reading from
the holy <i>Kethubim</i> of the Jews, the story of the Purim.
At each mention of Esther’s name the congregation
murmured “how beautiful is goodness;” at each mention
of Haman’s name all in the congregation stamped
their feet, also making gurgling noises with their
throats, to imitate the false prince’s strangling; the
whole being made more hideous by the shriek of discordant
cornet notes and the springing of rattles.</p>

<p>The foregoing scene suddenly changed; a procession
of maidens, in graceful evolutions, emerging from the
surrounding groves, presenting a living picture, really
entrancing. They were all richly robed in garments
of graceful flow, caught round their waists by flowered
girdles. Some wore sashes of jassamine, while others
were crowned with lilies or asters or violets. Their
arms and ankles were clad only with circlets from
which pendant bells gave forth music at every motion.
Seven of the foremost maidens bore lamps; behind
each of these followed one with a harp; behind
each harper two with tambourines and cymbals.
Seven times this maiden train, with a step in time,
half march, half dance, waltzed around the canopied
altar. Then were given seven cornet blasts, the procession
leaders waving their lamps with each blast,
after which there was perfect silence. Now the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
priest moved forward a little toward the procession;
the congregation meanwhile gathering in a semi-circle,
just outside of all, and he addressed the assembly:
“Brethren and children, I would speak to you a little
of the ‘Virtuous Woman.’ Daughters of Israel, hearts
of homes to be, hopes of the nation looking for a Deliverer
and deliverers yet to be born; hear me! Israel
knows no queen of all womanly perfections like unto
Esther, the beautiful. Evermore take her for your
meditation by day and your dreams by night. Then
shall you all realize to yourselves, your fathers, brothers,
husbands, all that the holy Proverbs of our <i>Kethubim</i>
declares of the true woman. Then the priest taking
the parchment, solemnly and in mellow tones, read
the last chapter of the book, ‘the birth-day chapter,’ a
verse prophetic for every day of the longest month, as
the Jews believe.”</p>

<p>When the reader ceased, the encampment was dim,
many of the lights having been quenched. Then the
congregation joined in chanting a soft-aired Jewish
hymn.</p>

<p>“The devotions are ended; now for the sports;” so
spoke Ichabod; the first words spoken between him and
the knight during their observation of the last part of
the proceedings before the pavilion. He had scarcely
made the announcement when the second patriarch appeared,
dressed in somber black, leading by the hand
a maiden of wondrous beauty, wearing also black, in
heavy trails; on her head a golden crown. As they
appeared the applause as at first burst forth, but now
blended with distinguishable cries of “Hail Esther!”
“Hail Mordecai!”</p>

<p>“It’s the play, knight. Watch that pair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“No fear, Jew, such a wondrous beauty! Had I
been Haman and she Esther, I never could have
crossed her. Heavens, Jew, it is well said the people
of promise produce the most beautiful women of earth.
That’s why Deity elected one of them, through whom
to be incarnate, I think.”</p>

<p>“I think I heard the knight say, awhile ago, that the
revolution of all religions was to come when men’s admiration
for women rose far above rapture over outward
form. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s thy remembering and my forgetting that
keeps us crossing each other! But no matter; am I
looking at an angel or not?”</p>

<p>“That’s the priest’s only daughter; his idol, ay,
the idol of every youth in all these parts of Israel.
No nation can be dead while it produces such flowers.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the camp blazed with re-illumination, and
then began a carnival. Games and dancers were
everywhere. Some, evidently men, were dressed as
women, and others, evidently women, were garbed as
men. For one season, Purim, the command against
the interchange of garments between the sexes, was
suspended. Each reveler carried a little box. If he
asked a favor or a question, the reply was a challenge
to try lots. Partners were so chosen, tasks given and
predictions made. Laughter was everywhere, and
wine was flowing.</p>

<p>“Ichabod, I haven’t tasted wine since Acre! Why
dost thou not introduce me yonder?”</p>

<p>“Wait; they will all be mellow, soon. They may
be, too, for it’s a law that a Jew is not deemed drunk
at ‘<i>Purim</i>’ so long as he can discern between a blessing
for Mordecai and a curse for Haman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens! how they do imbibe.”</p>

<p>“It’s natural for doves to twitter after a thunder
storm. They remember the past troubles.”</p>

<p>“Ay; but I fear they will consume all the beverage
before we are with them. We have had plenty of
trouble; now take me in to twitter with those doves.”</p>

<p>Ichabod started, as if to lead the way, and then drew
back and moaned, “no, no; it cannot be. I’m forever
anathema here, to them! I could bear their hate, not
their contempt. They may call me renegade, but
never spaniel nor hypocrite! If I appeared among them
they would soon know, if they do not already, that
Ichabod is changed. Then they’d sneer and tell me
that I tried to play double, or thinking my people’s
faith not good enough for me, I yet hungered for their
feasts. No, no; it must not be! To-morrow, I hope
to pray at my mother’s grave. I’d choke then if I had
to remember I’d done aught that she, living, would have
thought mean.”</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll not persuade thee, Jew, but go alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s reckless! thou mayst regret it. They may
become riotous, being half drunk, and beat thee as a
Haman. No, stay away.”</p>

<p>“No dissuasion, Jew, but just change garments. It’s
the fashion to-night.” The Jew complied, remarking
as he did:</p>

<p>“Will the knight wear this leather thong?”</p>

<p>“Heavens! no, nor the brand on thy neck.”</p>

<p>“Christian knights commanded me to wear one, and
burned into my flesh the other years ago; they deemed
it necessary to mark all Jews for hatred.”</p>

<p>“Dear Ichabod, I never counseled branding any
man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe it. I have forgotten all bitterness about
these marks and have borne them as my cross.</p>

<p>“But, Sir Charleroy, don’t wear thy cross in their
sight!”</p>

<p>“For once, I’ll cover it.” So saying he hid the
emblem.</p>

<p>The comrades parted, and Sir Charleroy quickly
found himself by the maiden who personated Esther.
He approached unnoticed until he pleasantly said:
“Queen of Shushan, a man out there behind a clump
of Sharon roses, played me a game of lots. I lost the
game, and he has put it on me to come to the Queen
to fix the forfeit I shall pay.” The maiden turned her
head haughtily and examined the speaker from head to
foot with repelling gaze. It was her way of freezing
off the amorous swains who constantly aimed to pay
her court. But when her eyes met those of the self-possessed
stranger, she gave a little start. Perhaps
she caught sight, by some omen, of her fate; perhaps
she felt the magnetism of the strong will which for the
first time presented itself. In any event, it was the first
time she had ever been alone, face to face, with such
as he; a stalwart man, all reverential, yet all self-possessed.
They were well matched, and they both
felt it, intuitively, instantly.</p>

<p>“Who art thou?”</p>

<p>“A child of God.”</p>

<p>“Of Israel?”</p>

<p>“By faith, most holy of Abraham’s seed,” responded
Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“Thy speech bewrayeth thee as lacking our shibboleth.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been a life long wanderer. Thou wouldst not reject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
one whom involuntary exile had robbed of
tokens?”</p>

<p>“But I can not be free with an uncertified stranger.
I’m afraid I err in tarrying here ’till now.”</p>

<p>“Hospitality is the boast of pious Hebrews who
obey Him that ‘loveth the stranger in giving him food
and raiment.’ Thou hast the Great Father’s law:
‘Love ye therefore the stranger, for ye were strangers
in the land of Egypt.’ Some have by hospitality unawares
entertained angels, thou knowst.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to entertain an angel; are they ever so
human-like as thou?” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Had I known the Esther of to-night long enough
to convince her that my freedom was sincere, I’d say
that she was a fine example of the union of the angelic
in the human.”</p>

<p>The maiden laughed. The incense was agreeable,
and the freedom of this feast-time justified her acceptance
of this novel, bold flattery. Your proud, daring
woman is very vulnerable to such assaults. The world
often wonders why such women so often, after all, surrender;
but that’s because the world does not appreciate
the dexterity in such jousts of such skilled men
of the world as Sir Charleroy; or how grateful to
self-admiring beauties the admiration of superior intellects
is.</p>

<p>“Well, will thou give me thy name?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. For to-night, Ahasuerus?”</p>

<p>“A presumptious jest, sir.”</p>

<p>“No, for I admire and respect Esther, that’s here.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I plead for help; gain me admittance to the festivities,
and escape from inquiry further, as to my identity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“And afterward, be called by my people brazen
by thee, a little fool!”</p>

<p>“Art thou driven from right, the claim of hospitality,
by fear of a lie?”</p>

<p>“What if thou wert a Bedouin spy, or a hated cross
follower?”</p>

<p>“Thou art a noble hearted maiden.”</p>

<p>“Ah, who told thee so?”</p>

<p>“Thy face.”</p>

<p>“What is that to thee, if true?” she blushed a little.</p>

<p>“Could’st thou drive from thy bosom a fleeing kid,
there seeking refuge from pursuing lions?”</p>

<p>“I do not know ’till tried. Thou art at any rate no
kid; there is no lion. If thou desirest refuge, see the
path of departure is the one by which thou cam’st
hither.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, farewell.”</p>

<p>The knight made as if he would go, but he knew he
would not. The motion gave him excuse for looking
sad, and he knew that next to a handsome face a sad
one most easily conquers a woman.</p>

<p>“Tarry a moment ’till I think. Can I trust thee?”
she was hesitating.</p>

<p>“I’ve trusted thee, and that’s ever the best proof of
fidelity.” Women like to think they are especially
trusted.</p>

<p>“Well——but, see, my father comes; there’s no
time for argument; let me speak!”</p>

<p>As the aged priest drew near, Esther saluted him,
and said, “Father, let me take this Galileean stranger
to the youths and their games? He claims our hospitality.”</p>

<p>The priest, wont to be on the alert, was disarmed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the magic word hospitality; then, too, for a long time
before, having been wifeless, he had been wont to put
his daughter forward, according large confidence to
her; hence his reply:</p>

<p>“If thou knowest him, Rizpah.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Welcome, brother, what is thy name?” said Harrimai.</p>

<p>Rizpah, his daughter, quickly made reply, “Ahasuerus,
and I’ve laughed at the <i>coincidence</i> until he has
been ashamed to repeat it.”</p>

<p>“’Tis strange, surely, and not like a Jewish one. I
must examine the family rolls to-morrow. Peace be
unto thee, son,” and the old man turned toward his
pavilion. Esther plucked a lily from her crown and
handed it to Sir Charleroy saying: “Here, king, a
token.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“Shushan; in our tongue, the name of the flower
signifies ‘surrender.’”</p>

<p>“They say, Esther, that Judith wore a crown of lilies
when she assassinated Holophernes. Is there any
danger to me impending?”</p>

<p>“Thou hast a lily. It is said to ward off enchantments,
too.”</p>

<p>“I am enchanted. I do not want to awaken. In
Egypt they call this the lotus, flower of unrestrained
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“For now then, we’ll call it lotus.”</p>

<p>“All gods, even Osiris, bless thee, Esther.”</p>

<p>So the twain were charmed comrades, till watch fires
were dim and the palm shadows were creeping in, like
funeral attendants, to carry away the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
dying revel. Here and there was heard anon the voices
commending this one and that to pleasant slumbers.
The stars were withdrawing behind dawn’s feathery
curtains, and over all, at intervals, was heard the voice
of the chanticleer, triumphantly proclaiming the coming
day.</p>

<p>Charleroy and Rizpah were left alone with each
other at the end of the last game.</p>

<p>The maiden gave a coy, furtive glance and tardily
drew away from the knight. The language of the
drawing-room of the day, is as old as the centuries, and
that maid of the wilderness used it as finely as a queen,
to say without words, “it’s time we part; please say so
first, nor leave to me, the hostess, the first suggestion
of a wish to have thee go——”</p>

<p>Still the knight spake not.</p>

<p>He was delighted and averse to breaking the first
pleasure spell of years.</p>

<p>The Jewish maiden, with fine courtesy, renewed the
subject: “King, methinks, thou art anxious to exchange
the grove for the palace.”</p>

<p>“I can never think of weariness when restful Esther
is nigh.”</p>

<p>“But thy life is precious to thy subjects; care for it,
and go with freshness to to-morrow’s cares of state.”</p>

<p>“Ah, queen, I too keenly realize that with thy departure
my kingdom fades to nothingness.”</p>

<p>“A truce, my liege.”</p>

<p>“Granted, and any thing else, to the half of my kingdom.”</p>

<p>Rizpah startled the birds in the shrubbery to premature
morning song, with a merry laugh. It was a finishing
charge, that laugh, by which she carried her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
point, for the knight quickly questioned “Why
this?”</p>

<p>“I was only thinking how odd thou wouldst appear if
thou didst wear away my pepelum. Thy subjects would
think their king mad, if he met them veiled as a
woman.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, queen, I’ve been so absorbed, I forgot myself—”
So saying, he gracefully transferred from his
shoulder to hers the shawl she had permitted him for
the night to wear. As the maiden adjusted it,
something fell out of its folds, glittering to her feet.</p>

<p>“Findings keepings;” she laughed, and stooped to
pick up the object. As she arose she turned it slowly
toward the setting moon the better to inspect the
find.</p>

<p>The knight was alarmed, but it was too late to prevent
her examination now of his Teutonic cross and
chain.</p>

<p>At a glance, Rizpah saw it was an emblem, of all
others, hated by her people, and with a low, startled cry
she made a motion as if to hurl it from her, but she
checked herself with a powerful effort; suddenly turning
her black, piercing eyes upon her companion she took
a step back. She stood there the embodiment of an
imperative question.</p>

<p>The knight quietly said: “Be calm, dear maid.”</p>

<p>Over her countenance passed a cloud which to the
man all too plainly said: “How darst thou use such
terms to me?” and then the face hardened again to imperative
interrogation.</p>

<p>“Thou trustedst me four hours ago, under the lotus,
try now my sincerity by any sterner test.”</p>

<p>Turning her eyes full on his, with a voice without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
quaver, but in deep, measured tones indicative of suppressed
emotion, she questioned as she held out toward
him his emblem, “What’s this?”</p>

<p>“Concealment from thee, having trusted me as thou
hast, would be futile not only, but hateful; thou knowst
the meaning of the sign.”</p>

<p>“Who art thou then?”</p>

<p>“A Christian knight!”</p>

<p>“An enemy of my people everywhere; a spy here!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, never a spy! a true Christian knight never was
such! Our warfare is open and equal. I’m degraded
by the defense from such an odious charge!”</p>

<p>“Why debate thy methods; ’tis enough for me to
know thou art a foe to me and mine.”</p>

<p>“No enemy of thine, but rather the friend of all humanity,
woman.”</p>

<p>“Bloody friends I’ve heard!”</p>

<p>“No! Each one of my order is sworn, by awful
vow, to protect the traveler, the poor, the weak and
woman with our last drop of blood! If we two were
all alone here and one of our lives must be forfeited to
save the other’s, mine would joy to go first.”</p>

<p>“Words are cheap, and thou can’st use them finely,
knight.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowst, maiden, to what that cross alludes.”</p>

<p>“The Nazarene Imposter!”</p>

<p>“His followers revere Him?”</p>

<p>“Like madmen, they follow their phantom!”</p>

<p>“Didst ever hear of one wearing that sign, being
untrue to it?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s their dread black-art.”</p>

<p>“Wouldst thou trust me if I swore by it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“I might; but I’d fear that devils would flock out of
the airy deep to witness thy vowing. Spare me that
horror!”</p>

<p>“Maiden, thou’lt craze me by thy distrust and wild
words. In God’s name tell me what to do!”</p>

<p>“Swear, but wave back the evil spirits, if thou art
wont to have them.”</p>

<p>“That sign is their lasting terror; but the silent
palms and the stars alone shall witness, ay, the God
of all, as well. Here, make thou the words as thou
wilt. Now, I kiss the cross I love, and am ready. He
suited the action to the words. The maiden drew
near to him, looking down into his eyes searchingly
and seemed assured by their serene frankness.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Rizpah, I’ll bind my soul with any words
coined, and, remember that I believe that perjury would
consign me to misery untold here; eternal woe hereafter!”</p>

<p>“I’ll trust thy solemn asseverations; they say that a
superstition on the right side will make even a Philistine
bearable. Repeat, ‘I swear never to harm any
of Rizpah’s kin or clan, except in self-defense.’”</p>

<p>He complied.</p>

<p>“Again, ‘I swear to depart peacefully at once, and
no more seek companionship with the people this
night met.’”</p>

<p>He complied, but murmured “cruelty.”</p>

<p>“And how?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“Wilt add a little?”</p>

<p>“Add what?”</p>

<p>“Add this ‘except by permission of the one ordaining
my vow.’”</p>

<p>“It is so fixed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I then swear it all.”</p>

<p>“Well, now go,” and she pointed to the hills.</p>

<p>“I obey, but yet plead delay.”</p>

<p>She hesitated and fell from being master to being
mastered.</p>

<p>“Why, what benefits delay?”</p>

<p>“Oh, woman, I yearn as only a lonely heart can, to
enjoy a little while the fellowship and hospitality of
thy people! For years homeless; for months friendless,
I’ve come to feel worthless. This is the first bright
hour in my life for many a day. Perhaps, maiden of
Israel, thou mightst make life worth living to me.”</p>

<p>It was a charge on her sympathy, and he knew it
would succeed.</p>

<p>“A Crusader, ‘one of the armies of God,’ boasting a
divine call to conquer and convert the world, so talking?”</p>

<p>“Our armed crusades are ended forever; my occupation’s
gone.”</p>

<p>She had hesitated, now she pitied the man, and
woman-like, again surrendered while she protested.</p>

<p>“I do not think there could come great harm from
thy staying until sunrise repast.”</p>

<p>“Bless thee, the nine sun gods bless thee, Esther.”</p>

<p>“Heathen!”</p>

<p>“Well; an Egyptian-Christian-Jew taught me to say
this when too cheerful to be solemn, and pious enough
not to be frivolous.”</p>

<p>“An Egyptian-Hebrew-Christian! He must have
been an Arab. That name means the ‘mixed.’ But
go to the men’s tents; to-morrow I’ll have more wisdom.
Peace and grace to thee; good night, Christian-Heathen-Hebrew-Arabic-Egyptian!”
She laughingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
spoke and the unbending made the knight, bold. He
addressed her:</p>

<p>“I’d sleep in perfect peace, if Rizpah would give
me a token.”</p>

<p>“I? what?” and the maiden drew back, offended.
Her innocency remembered no token then, but such
solicited by her maiden friends, or given at times to
her father, a kiss.</p>

<p>“Place thy hand in mine, Rizpah.” She quickly
complied, glad she was mistaken, as to her suspicion
and blushing within, as she thought how strangely,
easily, her mind had had the thought, “Well, now what,
knight?”</p>

<p>“Promise me that while I’m permitted to tarry among
thy people, I shall have thy heart’s friendship; as
freely, as loyally bestowed as if I were thy brother.”</p>

<p>“Canst trust me, a woman, a girl, almost a stranger?”</p>

<p>“I trust thy woman’s heart as Joshua’s men of old
trusted Rahab, a wreck, but still a woman. Thou art
infinitely more noble than she.”</p>

<p>“But men think us weak, fitful, garrulous.”</p>

<p>“Responsibility makes the weakest of thy sex heroines
and pity is the gateway to their hearts. Thou
hast my life and my happiness as thy responsibility;
dost pity me?”</p>

<p>“Yes: go now. A Gentile hater of my people shall
see of what metals Jewish maidens are.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Teutonic Knight of Saint Mary, through
all his changing fortunes from the time of
his knighthood’s vow, preserved his moral
integrity, his loyalty to the lofty pattern
of life set forth by the Queenly exemplar, Mary, the
mother of Jesus. Crusader days had so far improved
his life as to make him the outspoken denouncer of all
impurity of life. He thought his creed and his committal
thereto complete. A change came over him. He that,
in the storm of battle, had often cried as his law and his
delight “<i>Deus Vult</i>,” “God wills,” now feared to seek
to know, much less to do, that will. The intoxications
of a new love were upon him; unconsciously he was
suffering his queen to be veiled, eclipsed; and he yielded
to the tide that swept him toward the Jewish maiden.
Sometimes his conscience smote him, but he parleyed
with it, called it a fool, or placated it by the assurance
that this whole matter could be stopped any time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
will. Like many another man, forgetting all else except
that he was a refined animal, he passed away from
the beacons of Bethlehem to the chambers of Imagery,
the gods of Egypt. In chains of roses, though
with many fine Christian sentiments on his lips, he
went heart first, head first, into an utter committal of
all his being to the possession of his enchanter. He
expected to regard the laws of the land and society,
but nothing more. He was led by his tempting
spirit to Ramoth Gilead, now sometimes called
Gerara or Gerash. There it was that Rizpah’s family
took up its abode. With them, and of them, was Sir
Charleroy, a welcome guest, his welcome secured by
his own personal efforts to please, in part; but more
through the <i>finesse</i> of Rizpah, who having promised to
be a sister, was permitting her mind to wonder what
he might become if only her friend were a Hebrew.
Such day dreams were sinless, but impolitic if she
really meant to keep herself free and painless, when the
parting time came. But it so happens that the questions
and problems of the heart are thrust ever on life
when most responsive, least experienced. The wonder
is not that so many decide them ill, but that
youth so pressed, so ardent, so callow, as a whole
decide so fairly well the master social problem. The
life of Harrimai and his following was very Jewish at
Gerash. There was an unusual amount of national
pride evinced in that locality for the times. Sir Charleroy
was interested deeply in the place because of its
splendid ruins, he said, but as need not be explained,
chiefly on account of its natural beauties amid which
Rizpah was peerless. The Israelitish colony revered
the place for its ancient part in Jewish history, and because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
they believed no Moslem invader had ever defiled
the place. The knight and the Jewish father and
daughter were in frequent companionship. They were
becoming very intimate, meanwhile gaining power each
to make the other eventually very miserable.</p>

<p>Rizpah was pushing out in a new experience to her.
If she were enamored she did not fully know it. She
only knew that the knight’s companionship was very
delightful. If she had any misgivings as to the propriety
of her course she silenced them by saying to
herself: “Sir Charleroy has sworn to leave us forever
when I say he shall. I can end this matter any time.”
She thought she could, but the shield of her safety was
already too heavy for her. She could not have said
go, had she tried. Time deepened the perplexity by
multiplying the enmeshings of the trio. The knight
and Rizpah were much in each other’s society. They
spoke of this as being a happy circumstance, as youths
usually do. “We shall understand each other so well—too
well to misunderstand.” Some of the Jewish
young men were jealous and made some very natural
remarks, under the circumstances, though the remarks
were rather bitter with jealousy. The older people,
some of them, anxious for an alliance by marriage with
the rich and powerful Harrimai family, took up the
undertone complaints of the young people of their race.
Of course, the murmurings were cloaked with declarations
that they were all for the sake of righteousness!
Harrimai, in heart far from assured, was yet compelled
to defend the two secretly loving, in order to defend his
daughter’s fair fame. The two young people wore the
armor of teacher and pupil; the young woman constantly
bepraising the knight’s wondrous knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the antiquities, etc., of all the out-of-the-way places
they visited. So the meshes multiplied, though
the caviling was in part silenced. As teacher and
pupil they went on, and Harrimai knew, as did Sir
Charleroy, that the relationship had its peril, as it existed
between a man and woman who could love yet
ought not to love. Rizpah did not at first know how
easily a woman’s heart surrenders to a man to whom
she is accustomed to look upward. In fact she drifted
in a delight in all pertaining to the knight; her only
outlook and watchfulness being toward her father.
The way the latter at times keenly, silently observed
her and the knight made her uneasy. She knew intuitively
that not far away there was impending on her
father’s part an investigation. She determined to delay,
if not prevent it. One day she bounded into her
father’s presence, aglow with enthusiasm over the wonders
unfolded to her by Sir Charleroy during a visit to
the ruins of Gerash’s temple of the sun. The old man
was charmed by her description, and when she declared
her intention to pursue her investigations beyond their
city he hesitated to forbid.</p>

<p>“And now, father, I’m going to that old city of the
Giants, Bozrah.”</p>

<p>The father, with an effort at firmness, dissuadingly
replied:</p>

<p>“We may all go there, but not now. It is better
to bide here quietly, until we learn that the perils
of receding war have left assured peace.”</p>

<p>“Why, father, I’m not afraid!”</p>

<p>“I know it; so much the more need for me to be:
these over-daring daughters need over-careful guardians.
Some of us aged ones are suffered to tarry long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
from paradise, in order that we may see our darlings
in the right path thither.”</p>

<p>“Give me my swift white dromedary and two attendants
and I’ll defy the miserables who ambuscade
along the way.”</p>

<p>Just then, there dashed toward them, over the oleander-fringed
road which passed due north along the
little river and across the city, a rider on panting
steed.</p>

<p>“It’s the news runner!” said the patriarch.</p>

<p>“Shall we signal him?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“No, daughter, we will meet him yonder, where the
two great streets cross. He will await me.”</p>

<p>When the father and daughter arrived, a crowd had
already gathered about the horseman. Some pressed
him for news, but he looked straight ahead at his
horse, now slaking its thirst, and merely snapped out,
“News? My beast is thirsty!”</p>

<p>When Harrimai drew near the rider saluted him and
at once unfolded his budget: “Father, I’m this day
from Bozrah. Its ruins are not ruined. All around
there, and from there to here, the herds sleep in the
shade, and the carrion birds that have so long been
hovering around us for human food have fled back
to Egypt and Europe and Hades!”</p>

<p>“Praised be the Father of Israel! I shall live then,
as I prayed I might, to see the infidels slung out of
our holy places!” So spoke the priest, and as he affectionately
embraced some aged Israelites who gathered
about him, the horseman responded:</p>

<p>“God reigns and Israel has peace.” He put spurs to
his horse then, and dashed away across the river to
spread to other hamlets the glorious news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning Rizpah, having carried her point, was
ready to depart for Bozrah. She had taken silence
on her father’s part for consent, and pursued her preparations
as if it were so ordered. All things being ready
she silenced protest by a good-by kiss.</p>

<p>“But daughter! What escort?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” she thought, “victory! I can go if well attended.”
She continued aloud; “Perhaps Sir Charleroy’s
Egyptian might attend me, since our servants are
busy in the groves.” The maiden called to her Ichabod,
who had found a home in Harrimai’s establishment,
his identity hidden under the assumed name
Huykos, a name from the Nile land, meaning “Shepherd
King.” “I’ll take it,” said Ichabod, one day to
Sir Charleroy, “that all unknown I may follow my
pilgrim comrade and perhaps honor my new found
‘Shepherd King.’”</p>

<p>“One will be a meager escort daughter,” interposed
Harrimai.</p>

<p>“Oh, fear for me nothing, father. I’ll quickly be at
Bozrah, where there are Israelites not a few who will be
proud to aid thy daughter.”</p>

<p>“No, daughter it must not be. I’ll call the young
men from the vineyard, if thou must go.”</p>

<p>“Another victory,” her heart whispered; then
quickly turning to Sir Charleroy she exclaimed, “My
father must not call the workmen from their tasks;
what sayst thou? Wilt serve us both by joining my
body-guard, Ahasuerus? Come, to please my father?”</p>

<p>The knight had hoped for and expected the summons,
so needed no urgency and was instantly preparing
for the start.</p>

<p>Harrimai was not pleased by the arrangement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
yet he was forced to thank the knight for consenting.
His native courtliness compelled this much, and Rizpah’s
genius had precluded all gainsaying on his part.
And so they rode away, Rizpah in a delight, which she
could not clearly define; Sir Charleroy blinded already
by the cry that at last led to giant Samson’s blinding,
namely: “Get her for me.” Ichabod masked under
his name, Huykos, followed after, knowing that the
knight was captive to the maid and feeling very happy
over the circumstance. As he rode, his mind ran forward
to the wedding, and he laughed again and again
at the witty things he imagined himself saying at that
wedding. Suddenly the scene changed from one of
careless delight to one filled with the frights of impending
peril. At a turn in the road, from behind a wall,
there rose up a company of Mamelukes. Rizpah saw
them the instant her companion did and exclaimed,
as she half turned her camel:</p>

<p>“Let’s race back to Gerash!”</p>

<p>But four dusky sentinels were behind them. They
were surrounded.</p>

<p>“’Tis fight or flight, the latter futile,” whispered the
knight. They paused, and Ichabod joined them. Sir
Charleroy drawing his sword again spoke: “Comrade
it’s a desperate chance; a dozen to two; but we have
taken such before together!”</p>

<p>“Let the knight say a dozen to three,” exclaimed
Rizpah, as she drew from the folds of her garments a
saber before unseen and touched the edge expert-like
with her thumb.</p>

<p>“Oh, brave, pure girl! I don’t fear death; I’d court
it for thee, but”—Sir Charleroy paused and looked unutterable
misery; then instantly recovering and emboldened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
by the danger that threatened to soon end
all, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Rizpah, thou rememberest my knight-vow at
Purim; thou shalt see how I’ll keep it; if I perish, remember
I have loved thee as I never loved any other
being.” The words were very vehement, but probably
very true. Rizpah blushed, brushed a tear from her
eyes and then, in the frankness that such an hour engenders,
replied: “And I thee—” the rest was drowned
in the wild shout of the Turks as they close about the
three. But they had not counted upon such a reception
as those two men and that one woman gave them.
Ichabod fought like a roused mastiff, without a thought
of fear for himself. He struck vehemently, but a
calm settled smile was on his countenance. Sir Charleroy
saw it and years after said, recalling the incident,
“amidst the greatest perils there’s a wondrous peace
to one who feels he is striking for God, close to the portals
of death and judgment.” The knight himself
fenced with the rapidity of lightning. Again and again
by ones and twos and threes, the enemies charged down
upon him, but he fought with the prowess of a crusader,
the fire of a lover. Those parts had never before witnessed
such splendid swordsmanship. As the attack
had been sudden, so was its ending. Two Turks fell
beneath Sir Charleroy’s weapon in quick succession,
and a third fell under his own horse, which was desperately
wounded by a sweeping blow from the knight.
At the same, instant, almost, Ichabod and one of the foemen,
whom he was engaging, fell in significant silence,
while another struggled to drag Rizpah to his steed
that he might make her captive. Sir Charleroy,
wounded and faint, dealt the latter miscreant a staggering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
blow and the maiden, plucking a small dagger
from the folds of her garment, finished with a single
thrust her captor’s earthly career.</p>

<p>Those of the marauders that were able, in fright took
flight, wheeling away more quickly than they had
come.</p>

<p>“Rizpah, wilt thou go to Ich—Huykos? I can’t,”
softly called out Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>The maiden flew to the Jew’s side, but quickly started
back, crying: “Oh, knight, come quickly! He’s dead!”
Just then, looking back, a sudden horror fell upon her,
for she saw Sir Charleroy half reclining against a rock,
bleeding and pale. Like lightning she thought: “Both
dead; I alone; home miles away; the Turks hovering
near.”</p>

<p>But the thought of her own peril was only momentary,
and after it there came more rapidly than can be
written the thought that one dear as her life was dead,
dead for her sake. Instantly, on feet that seemed
winged, she was at Sir Charleroy’s side. All her being
merged into one great, instant impulse to save her
lover. Over him she bent, and with passionate sorrow
tried with her garments to staunch the flow of blood.
In the sincerity and frankness that the presence of
death ever brings, she arose above all prudishness and
impulsively kissed the cold lips of the knight. His
eyes opened, and he faintly murmured:</p>

<p>“I’m so happy, dear Rizpah. I know now it is well.”
A little later he murmured: “Flee now for home.
Thou’lt reach it by sun down. Leave me. To tarry is
to court a harem prison.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” impatiently responded she; “see this dagger?”
and she held it close to his half-closed eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
“My pious father gave it me when I was but a girl.
He told me it might some time save me from dishonor.
It did so to-day, once. If those black demons
return, sure as my name is Rizpah, it will do so again,
even though I turn it toward my own heart.”</p>

<p>“Better flee, my love.”</p>

<p>“Not ’till thou can’st go, too.”</p>

<p>“I may die.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll go into the shadow land with thee.”</p>

<p>The knight was silent. The pain of his wounds was
forgotten in the joy of that lone companionship. But,
after all, his mind, perturbed by the shock, the pain,
the dangers, was unable to rest. He tried to say to
himself the prayer of the dying crusader, but the words
were confused. He could not remember many of them;
those he remembered, seemed to be unwilling to go
heavenward for mercy. Some way in the clearness of
judgment as to simple right and wrong that comes to
a mind on the confines of death, he found himself condemned.
He was haunted by a vision that came to his
mind first the day he decided against conviction, at all
hazard, to follow the family of Rizpah and Harrimai
to Gerash. The vision was that of the false
prophet Zedekiah, making himself horns of iron, and
with them appearing before the wicked King of Israel,
Ahab, to proclaim, not the things of God, but the
things the prophet knew would meet the desires of
his royal master. The wounded often fall asleep;
it’s nature’s way of recovering from a shock and of
chaining pain in forgetfulness. Sir Charleroy knew
not whether he was sleeping or not; but the vision
passed in painful vividness over his mind. He heard
the prophet’s voice saying: “Go up to Ramoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Gilead, and prosper.” Then he saw a true prophet
of God standing nigh, with sorrowful countenance,
and the face was that of the Madonna. The latter
moaned in his ear, warningly; “<i>Who shall persuade,
that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead? Then
there came forth a spirit and said, I will persuade.</i>”</p>

<p>The spirit was black-garbed, in a blood-spotted garment,
and wore, as Sir Charleroy seemed to see the
apparition, a scarlet crescent, and the knight thought
of Astarte. He heard in his vision the beatings as
of mighty wings, rising to flight, and tried to turn
and see who the departing one was. It seemed as
if the spirit of Astarte-like countenance transfixed
him with a gaze, so he could not turn; but a loneliness
and darkness, almost palpable, came over him, and
he knew it was the Madonna-faced prophet that had
departed. The knight started up as if to rise, but,
awakening, found Rizpah’s restraining arms about him.</p>

<p>“Stay,” she soothingly said. “Thou art feverish,
and too weak to rise. Thou’lt be better presently;
the blood has ceased flowing.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he groaned; “I had such a dream!”</p>

<p>Just then Rizpah beheld coming in the distance,
from toward Gerash, a horseman, at rapid pace. Her
first thought, “The enemy returns.” Her second
brought her hand swiftly to her reeking dagger, as
she soliloquized: “He’s only one, and I’m one; if
but a woman.”</p>

<p>The rider drew nearer, and she was almost overcome
with the revulsion from fear and despair; for
the comer was Laconic, the “news runner.” He
knew the maiden, and wheeling his steed to her side
with his usual brevity, cried out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, didst thou kill both?”</p>

<p>“Shame on thee; ’twas the Arabs!”</p>

<p>“I thought so. I met two horsemen and two riderless
steeds, galloping away down the road. I knew
they’d been at some devilment.”</p>

<p>“Good runner, in the name of God, speed thee
to Bozrah, or somewhere, for help, and bring it quickly.”</p>

<p>“Bring? not so; send. <i>I</i> come not ’till my set day!”</p>

<p>“Any thing; but hurry!”</p>

<p>“Hurry! Yes, hurry! I love hurry.”</p>

<p>He was away like an arrow, in his course. His steed
leaped over one of the dead miscreants and Laconic
shouted back: “Carrion dinners! Thank God!”</p>

<p class="dropcap">For many days Sir Charleroy lay wounded at
the house of the Patriarch Harrimai, and
she for whom he had periled his life was
his constant attendant. He sorely needed
her services, and all Gerash, the priest included, conceded
the fitness of Rizpah’s rendering the aid she was
able to render. The maiden was all willing to minister,
and as she ministered her interest in the man deepened.
When she began to look up to him as her teacher
before the battle with Mamelukes, she began a sort of
worship; when she saw him fighting to the death in her
behalf, her worship became an engrossing adoration.
If there had been any thing more required in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
enlist all the affection of which her being was capable,
these opportunities of administering to her suffering
lover furnished it. As God loves because He has
helped a needy one, so a woman’s heart easily flows out
toward the object for whom she has performed pious
services. On the other hand, Sir Charleroy was more
and more enchanted, for there is life and charm beyond
all description to the touch of the queen of a man’s
heart when he is in trouble or pain.</p>

<p>Rizpah, in woman’s most queenly garb, the one appointed
her at her creation, that of “help-mate,” was
beautiful indeed, and queenly indeed, to the man whose
heart had enthroned her. When alone, they treated
each other with the frank, earnest tenderness, fitting as
well as natural, to the betrothed. Though they did
not admit it even to themselves, they had fully determined
to be one, at all peril, in spite of any opposition,
reason approving or disapproving. They often said to
one another, “Our betrothal taking place at the very
gates of death was therefore a very solemn one that
nothing on earth can annul.” The sentiment was perfect
and very agreeable; and with them a beautiful
and agreeable sentiment became as controlling as if it
were a revelation from heaven. In this, they were
perfectly human. They even persuaded themselves of
God’s favor, thanking Him for what they were pleased
to call His Providence, namely the peril and long sickness
leading to the betrothal and days of love-life together.
They were right in conceding that God’s hand
was in the battle; but they were impious in interpreting
His Providence to be fully in accord with their
desires. In this, too, they were very human. But there
were shadows about them; for while at times they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
drifted along on prismatic tides of Lethean delights,
there were other times when they remembered that
there was to come a day of explanation, with probable
following storms. Both were glad and sorry at once, in
view of each day’s improvement of the knight’s physical
condition. Convalescent, they both realized, meant
a great change in their relationship; perhaps a long
separation. Their anxiety was deepened by a change in
the demeanor of Rizpah’s father. His eyes no longer
questioningly followed the young people; but his words,
uttered in tones of steelly coldness and very deliberately,
bespoke discovery, conviction, conclusion and
determination. One sentence often addressed to the
lovers, was to them like the rumblings of an approaching,
gathering storm. “Our friend is improving, and
I’m very glad that he will be able soon to go to his
own dear people.” The lovers discerned a peculiar
emphasis on the words “I’m glad” and “his own dear
people.” The politic priest, having read, as from an
open book, the heart-secret of the young people, was
awaiting with self-confidence an opportunity to confound
them utterly. The crisis came one Sabbath
morning, just after the morning meal of the convalescent.
Harrimai had paid his usual visit and uttered his
steelly sentences. This time the words seemed especially
cruel to Rizpah, for she was nervous, indeed ill;
the prolonged services and anxieties she had experienced
of late were telling on her strength. As Harrimai
departed, she gave way to a flood of tears. Rizpah
was not wont to weep, nor was Sir Charleroy
skilled in comforting; but both he and she were lovers,
hence it seemed very natural to her frankly to pillow
her head on the knight’s shoulder, and very natural to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
him to seek to comfort with a tenderness all new to
him. Had one asked Rizpah if she were going back to
babyishness, or forward toward heaven, she could
not have answered. Had one asked the knight if he
were becoming motherly, or turning priest, he could not
have answered. He felt very tender, and his work of
comforting seemed like an act of high piety. Both
were glad of the tears which brought the joy of comforting
and being comforted, then, there and that way.
They were passing into a superb mood when quite unexpectedly
to them, but quite expectedly to himself,
Harrimai suddenly re-entered the apartment. He
expected to surprise them and he did so, thoroughly.
The scene following was exciting, dramatic and
decisive.</p>

<p>Rizpah, with a slight scream, disengaged herself
from Sir Charleroy’s embrace, and hid her face in her
hands. The eyes of the knight and priest met; neither
quailed; both remained for a few moments silent; but
their fixed gaze said plainly enough, each to each, “We
must have a settlement here and now!” Harrimai
spoke first, addressing himself to his daughter: “Young
woman, this conduct is immodest and disgraceful! In
a Hebrew maiden, heaven defying! I’ll speak to thee
further of this presently. Now, begone, and leave me
to deal with this man!” Harrimai made arrogant by
his profession and the implicit obedience he had been
wont to receive from his followers, expected to fill the
young people with dismay by the suddenness of his
assault. But Rizpah, though young, was no tongue-tied
spring, and Sir Charleroy of Gerash was still Sir Charleroy
of Acre.</p>

<p>The words “dishonorable,” “immodest,” stung the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
maiden; sullenly, defiantly almost, she settled back
in her seat and leaned toward the knight, as if to say,
“I cast my lot with this man.” Her eyes plainly, angrily
said to the man whom all her life hitherto she
had reverently obeyed, “Now do thy worst.” It was
impious, passionate, love going headlong from filial
duty and religious instruction to the shrine of Astarte.
The parent was chagrined at this unexpected repulse,
but with his usual adroitness pretending not to notice
it, he turned to the knight. “Stranger, this outrage excuses
abruptness on my part; who art thou?”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy arose from his hammock, the excitement
and shock of the rencounter finishing his recovery,
by rousing all the machineries of his system into
normal activities.</p>

<p>“Sir Priest, I’ve nothing to conceal. I love the truth
and this maiden too well to lie—I am a Christian
knight.”</p>

<p>“I knew it; but thy confession shortens our parley.
Now, ‘Christian knight,’ tell me why thou didst attempt
to allure to thyself the affections of a mere girl; a
Jewish maiden whom thou canst never hope to wed?
Dost thou so pay our hospitality; setting at defiance
parental authority and our Jewish laws? Dost thou
under the favors of this house intrigue to quench all
its light?”</p>

<p>“Thou brandst that girl and me with the epithet ‘dishonorable;’
and thou a priest! Men of thy holy calling
should never slander, especially not their own
kin and strangers.” The knight was livid, but not with
fear.</p>

<p>“Can an Israelite slander Crusaders? these professors
of high religion, these followers of an impostor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
these enemies of my people, these practicers of
intrigues, races, jousts, gluttonies and drunkenness;
men whose sole serious business is murderous war?
Tell me?”</p>

<p>The knight’s face flushed a little, but with complete
self-control he replied:</p>

<p>“Some of my comrades have been unworthy men,
’tis true; but some Jews have fallen to every crime
and violence. Have all fallen? Thou hast not, perhaps!
Shall all be maligned for the few? What says
Harrimai?”</p>

<p>“Thou art of those, who come to thrust us out of
our land and thrust in here a hated creed!”</p>

<p>“I am of those who live to serve the needy and erring.”</p>

<p>“To the proof; I’ve heard from thy clans only of
bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“Our order sprung up four hundred years ago, under
the stirring appeals of religionists as pious and humane
as thou; or any of thy kind since Aaron. We
were begotten in a time when grim famine made the
well-fed wondrous kind. Those hours that make men
universally akin.”</p>

<p>“Go on; ‘Christian knight,’ I’d like a lesson of
that sort.”</p>

<p>“Then remember Noah’s covenant of peace. On
our banners often we have our spirit expressed by a
dove flying toward a tempest-tossed ark; in the messenger’s
beak an olive branch; around the whole the
bow of promise.”</p>

<p>“Well what of all this?”</p>

<p>“The ark is the world; the rest is plain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a charming theory,” sarcastically responded
Harrimai.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wear it next my heart;” so saying the knight
threw aside his cloak and drew from around his body a
banner he had hitherto concealed. “See here, ‘<i>chastity</i>,’
‘<i>temperance</i>,’ ‘<i>courtesy</i>.’ Our mottoes in peace or
war! Women, children and pilgrims, in a word the
needy the world around, are the wards of all true
Christian knights!”</p>

<p>“Mottoes! words! Oh, yes, words! But then the
Crusaders have used swords! Their words I’ll meet
with words to their confounding, nor while I live will I
forget their cruel weapons.” So saying the priest swept
out of the sick chamber in manifest rage.</p>

<p>He returned in a moment, and with the self-command
of wrath, conscious of power, said: “Thou
wouldst make all men <i>akin</i>! Thou and thine are
dreamers, the world thinks; to-day it laughs to scorn
this bootless pursuit of a chimera. Leave us forthwith
and in the peace that thou foundst here. When
the kinship is reality, thou mayst come to us for further
talk; ’till then remember thou art a Christian, I
a Jew!”</p>

<p>“Thou art religious! Heavens! what a tender
shepherd.”</p>

<p>Harrimai was very much angered, but he retorted
with self-control; “Oh, yes, and the God of all hath
seven garments. In creation, honor and glory; in
providence, majesty; as lawgiver, might and whiteness;
of spotless light when he appears as a Saviour. He is
clad with zeal when he punishes, and with blood red
when He revenges. I would be like Him. By the
glory of God! thou follower of Nazereth’s Impostor,
sooner than suffer thy blood to contaminate my family
lines, I’d hew thee to pieces as Agag was hewn! Rizpah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
thou knowest me; wed him and thou’lt be widowed,
though carrying the unborn; though widow-hood
broke thy heart. I’d rather a thousand times see thee
lying dead by thy true Jewish mother than——.”
The priest, in a tumult of fanatical passion mingled
with the grief of offended pride, lacked for words to
express the climax of his feelings; so covering his
tearless eyes, as one weeping, he rushed out from
those he had assailed. He persuaded himself that he
had spoken all for the glory of God; the lovers thought
of their solemn betrothal and their love which they
were certain was as fine as any earth ever knew, and
they felt that they were martyrs. Both sides appealed
to God and in a spirit very ungodly, but very human,
braced themselves for opposing war.</p>

<p>When the maiden became somewhat calm, Sir
Charleroy found words to question:</p>

<p>“Harrimai cannot find heart to blast his idol’s happiness!
He does not mean all he said?”</p>

<p>“Alas, he does. It’s part of the Patriarch’s religion
to hate such as thou, as he does. He means more, if
possible, than he spoke. Our people unveil the bosom
and cover the mouth; thine cover the bosom and unveil
the mouth. Ye talk, we burn.”</p>

<p>“Has pure love like ours no sanctity in his sight?”</p>

<p>“Alas, he can not believe any love pure that is between
Gentile and Israelite. He was sneering at ours
a few evenings ago, when he remarked as we were
looking at the stars, ‘Hyperius or Venus of the evening
is mistakenly called the star of love. Lucifer of the
morning is the true emblem of most young love. It
rises in maddening brightness, but fades out of sight
very soon.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grim omen! We took Venus for our betrothal
star; they say it is so bright at times that it casts a
shadow. I feel its shadow now,” said the knight, meditating.</p>

<p>“Yes, shadows and shadows!” exclaimed Rizpah,
with a flood of tears, and she swayed back and forth
as she wept. She was driven by tempests of fear that
made her ready to flee, and held by anchors of passionate
loving that made her ready to brave all fears;
therefore the swaying and weeping. At intervals the
two communed and debated concerning the one all-engrossing
theme, their future course.</p>

<p>“Rizpah,” comfortingly spoke the knight, “when
in the greatest peril of our lives, we were drawn, by
danger, closer to each other.” There was a glance of
entreaty in her eyes as if to say, “Go save thy life and
let the Jewish maiden die alone;” but the knight drew
her to his bosom, and she responded by an embrace of
passionate clinging.</p>

<p>“I go from Rizpah only at her command or death’s,”
said the knight solemnly.</p>

<p>The maiden shuddered, and again passionately clung
to her lover. He interpreted her action, and again
comfortingly spoke:</p>

<p>“Fear not; earth has somewhere a refuge for us
until death call us!”</p>

<p>“Somewhere? What, go away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is that or separation.”</p>

<p>She knew that full well. But to flee from home with
the knight, the alternative presented to her mind,
startled her. At first thought it seemed a reckless,
perilous, unfilial, God-defying act; then it seemed attractive
because so daring. A tumult of arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
questionings, fears and yearnings mingled in her mind.
She had never learned to arrange arguments, <i>pro</i> and
<i>con</i>, judicially. What woman whose feelings were
aroused ever did that?</p>

<p>He pressed on her flight, enforcing each reason presented
with an affectionate embrace; her tongue spoke
not, but her embraces replied to each of his. She had
a conscience, and it asserted itself until she placated it
by a half formed resolution to be very prudent and do
nothing rashly. The resolution comforted her at first;
then she began to follow it, mentally, to its sequence.
She thought of her father praising her piety as her
purpose was disclosed. Something within, coming like
a voice from her heart, mockingly whispered “Go on.”
She pursued the meditations, and heard, in imagination,
her neighbors praising her as a martyr of love for
faith’s sake. Again the mocking inner voice said, “Go
on.” Again her thoughts moved forward until she saw
that conscience was driving her to separation from
Sir Charleroy; in a word, making her walk in a funeral
procession, her own dead heart on the bier. The
thought made her shudder and recoil; then the
knight’s arms encircled her more closely than before.
Again and again she took the foregoing mental journey,
again and again recoiled, shuddering from the
alternative of separation from her lover, and at each
recoil felt his grateful embrace. Each time she traversed
the mental course the journey toward duty by
the privation of love seemed more onerous. Distaste
was followed by repugnance; then utter weariness. At
last, utterly wretched, her purposes and perceptions fell
into hopeless confusion, and she exclaimed “Charleroy,
Charleroy, save me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The knight was at a loss to divine fully her meaning,
yet tenderly he answered:</p>

<p>“Save Rizpah? She knows I’d do that in death’s
teeth!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Charleroy, ’tis not death, but life, that I fear.
How shall I live?”</p>

<p>Quickly he ejaculated:</p>

<p>“With me, forever, and safe!”</p>

<p>The maiden remembering many an admonition she
had heard concerning the inconstancy of lovers, yet
driven forward by the all-abandoning love of her
woman’s heart, gave voice to all she felt and feared in
one vehement interrogation:</p>

<p>“Oh, Charleroy, if I forsake all for my love of thee
shall I ever be discarded by——?”</p>

<p>The knight interpreted her meaning in advance, and
answered by an embrace that was all-assuring. He
was rejoiced beyond words, for he knew full well that
hesitation and questionings like hers were on the rim of
full surrender. Suddenly he became very serious and
felt that peculiar glow that came over him the day of
his departure from England when the bishop blessed
him. He appreciated in a measure the responsibility
following such a committal of another’s life to himself
as Rizpah was making, and he embraced her with an
anxious reverence, such as a pietist feels clasping an
ideal of his God. It was well for both that the man
was thus impressed by the committal of that maiden
of her soul and body to his pilotage. Pity the woman
who reaches the extremity Rizpah had reached if her
conqueror be not white-souled and sincere.</p>

<p>Rizpah an incarnation of passion, a wreath of lotus
flowers on a sea of delight, tossed by the winds, borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
by the tides, surrendered all thoughts that might
disturb, that she might enjoy what she had embraced
as her fate to the full.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy constantly prayed within himself,
“My mother’s God help me to deal as purely with my
sacred charge as I would with the Virgin Patron of my
knightly order, were she here now to seek my knightly
services.” The prayer was effectual, for the Knight
sincerely sought to make it so.</p>

<p>Decisive action followed this interview between the
lovers. That very night they fled together from Gerash,
and with only one trusty servant; after many vicissitudes
they reached Damascus. For a time Rizpah
placated her conscience by asserting that she would
not consent to the wedding ceremonial until it could
have her father’s approval, or that of some Jewish
Rabbi. Finding it impossible to obtain these, she irresolutely
suggested the advisability of delaying until
some change, quite vaguely apprehended, might come.
But there were two Rizpah’s—one that wanted to be a
faithful Jewess, and one that wanted only and constantly
a darling idol. Sir Charleroy sided with the
latter; it was two to one, and the one surrendered.
Ere long a Christian missionary at Damascus sealed the
vows. They confided their story to him, as if to ask
his advice as to what they had best do, but with the
impetuosity of lovers they had decided their course
before they asked advice, and did not even ask it
until they had pledged their vows before this priest.
But it was a balm to conscience to ask advice. And
the Sacrist answered them briefly: “Venus and Mercury,
fabled deities of love and wisdom. They are
much alike in the firmament, and revolve in orbits in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
accord with the earth’s. Methinks it is <i>wisdom</i> to <i>love</i>
in the earth. But, children, Venus sets sooner than
Mercury; see to it that you make it your wisdom to
love as long as you go round with the world.” Then
they both said “Amen.” For a moment Sir Charleroy
heard within him that impressive sound as of the beating
of mighty, departing wings. He dragged his attention
quickly from the introspection to gaze into
the eyes of his bride. He was glad that a Christian
priest had prayed for a blessing upon himself
and her, but all sophistry aside, the truth remained.
Astarte’s was the presiding spirit at that wedding.</p>

<p>“Bashan is the land of sacred romance.” “His mission [Paul’s,
Gal., 1: 15] to Bashan seems to have been eminently successful.
Heathen temples were converted into churches, and new churches
built in every town.” “In the fourth century nearly the whole of
the inhabitants were Christian.” “The Christians are now nearly
all gone.” “Nowhere else is patriarchal life so fully exemplified.”
“Bashan is literally crowded with towns, the majority of them
deserted, but not ruined.” “Many are as perfect as if finished

<p class="dropcap">For a brief period the delightful seasons, the
famed rivers, the stately surrounding mountains,
the paradisiacal plains, the antiquities,
the pleasure gardens and palaces of the
city of Damascus, whose name by interpretation is
“change,” offered sought-for gratification to the knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and his bride. Harrimai died suddenly after the
elopement of his child, the only person on earth whom
he truly loved, the only one that had ever successfully
defied his mandates. He had purposed disinheriting
her for her act, but before he could execute that purpose,
death disinherited him. Some said that he died
of a broken heart; the physicians said he was taken off
by a fit; Sir Charleroy said he died because his proud
will was crossed. Rizpah inherited a fortune that
helped both her and her husband to forget the old
priest’s maledictions by enabling them to enjoy all
there was to be enjoyed in Damascus, “the eye of the
East.” They gave up unreservedly to pleasure, and
centered the world more and more in themselves. Sir
Charleroy did this easily, reasoning that, having had
so many pains, he was entitled to compensating pleasures.
He heard from England; and the news was to
the effect that there had been changes and changes in
his native land. Many of those he once knew, including
his mother, were dead; and he himself was forgotten
as dead. Sententiously, bitterly he summed up
his feelings: “They thought me dead, and, my mother
and her fortune being gone, did not care to find out
whether I was dead or not; therefore let them think
as they thought.” Rizpah feared the lashings of conscience,
and, having given up every thing once dear to
enter the life she had, courted forgetfulness of the past,
pleasure for the present. The two had within themselves
exuberant youth, a wealth of possibilities of
happiness; the elements that, like the abundance of
the volcano, paints the sky gorgeously when rising
heavenward; like it, in the downward course, followed
by darkness and disaster. The two, differing in almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
every thing but fervor of temperament, were in accord
in pursuit of change; they persuaded themselves that
they were growing to be like each other, when they
were only exalting the one thing, love of excitement,
in which they were alike.</p>

<p>Damascus, naturally, in time, became uninteresting
and vapid to them both. They wore it out; they
wanted new scenes. They heard that a caravan of
Mohammedan pilgrims was to pass through their city
on the way to Mecca to procure besim balm and holy
chaplets, and promptly determined to journey with it;
but not to Mecca. The caravan was to pass through
Bashan, and the two excitement-seekers desired to visit
the latter land of wonders. They readily garbed
themselves as Mohammedans, though once they would
have loathed such garbing as a defilement. They
desired company toward Bashan, and since the time
they defied their consciences in order to be wedded to
each other, their consciences had been wont to be very
submissive in the face of their desires. They explained
to themselves the absence of qualms of conscience in
the face of a pretense of being Moslems, as the result
of a growth toward liberality on their part. The
explanation made them comfortably complacent,
although the fact was that they had passed far beyond
liberalism toward nothingism.</p>

<p>Passing Musmeth and Khubat of the Argob, they
tarried after a time at Edrei, just inside the shore line
of that mysterious black, lava sea, the Lejah. They
were in a country where nature, art and desolation had
done their greatest. Following a passing impulse
seemed to them to have brought them thither, but one
believing in God’s constant providence will readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
believe that they were led thither as to a school. There
were omen and prophecy confronting them. These
fervent souls had gone from hymen’s altar filled with
romancings, under a glow of prismatic auroras, never
pausing to perceive that from each wedding time there
winds a troop of serious years burdened with many a
commonplace duty. Their love had been volcanic,
their impulses ecstatic, their aims toward things filled
with commotion. The wine in their cup was to leave
dregs; after the fire there was to be ashes, and it was
fitting that they contemplated a specimen of great desolation
and dreariness, the result of great fires and
great storms. So they were within that wonder of the
world, three hundred and fifty square miles of awful
plain, filled with ruined towns and cities. Heaved up
here and there by jutting basalt rocks, the plain seemed
filled with black ice-bergs; ridged at intervals the plain
suggested an ocean wave-tossed. Therein is many a
cave and cranny place, fit abode for the wild beast or
robber; fit abode for ghosts, if one seeks to believe
there are such. But therein were only a few green
spots, oases, to bid the traveler welcome. Ere long
the knight and his consort wore out the Lejah, and, in
so doing, in part, wore out themselves. They had a
fullness of the pleasure of the kind which lacks recreation.
As it was, they stayed there longer than it was
well for them to stay.</p>

<p>Rizpah, the passion flower of Gerash, experiencing
the supreme exaction of womanhood now, began to
droop. Months spent in pursuit of excitement, the
great change in her manner of life, as well as the
oppressive desolations of her surroundings, had drawn
heavily upon her resources physically. Reaction after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
exaltation, and nervous discord after nervous tension
are natural results, always.</p>

<p>The knight discerned the change of temper, and as
an anxious novice went about correcting the matter.
He knew little concerning woman, except that love of
her intoxicates; delighting in the intoxication he
sought to stimulate Rizpah’s flagging energies by
pushing her onward into the feverish brilliancy that
was so delightful to himself. It was an attempt
to cure physical impoverishment by the renewal of its
causes. She was at times complacent, because incompetent
to resist; passive, because enervated. He was
most selfish, though not realizing the fact, when trying
to be most tender. In fact, the twain were on the rim
of a test period in their married life and being unskilled
in its common places, unfitted to stand the test. Sir
Charleroy had recourse to the only physician he deemed
adequate; one whom on account of his dress he called
“Old Sheepskin.” This was a guide, with a motly
group of Druses assistants, and an unpronouncible
name.</p>

<p>“Come, Rizpah, ‘Old Sheepskin Jacket’ has put on
his red tunic and leathern girdle to carry us a camel
voyage in-sea; if we do not give the man a job he’ll fall
to stealing again.”</p>

<p>Rizpah languidly shook her head.</p>

<p>“But we must patronize the man to keep up what
little honesty he has, and he has some. He told me
but yesterday he’d rather work than rob—though the
pay be less, so is the danger less.”</p>

<p>The knight was telling the truth as well as trying to
be facetious.</p>

<p>Again Rizpah replied with a weary shake of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
head, her hands rising deprecatingly, then falling into
her lap as if almost nerveless.</p>

<p>“But, Rizpah, while we are here we ought to fully
explore the changeless cities of this dead, black, lava
sea. There are none other like this on earth! ’Tis
nature’s desperate effort to outrun phantasmagoria.”</p>

<p>Rizpah shook her head and waved her hands; this
time vehemently, as if to repel a horror.</p>

<p>“What? A fixed no?”</p>

<p>“No more excursions into this counterpart of hades
for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, so be it to-day, at least,” with surrendering
tones, the knight replied.</p>

<p>“To-day? All days! Oh, God, remove me from
this nightmare!”</p>

<p>So exclaiming, the woman covered her eyes, shuddered
and wept hysterically.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy was almost overcome with sudden
amazement. The tears, the terror, the complete
change before him, were beyond his comprehension.
After a time he again spoke: “Why, this is a sudden
freak or frenzy. I thought Rizpah fascinated here!”</p>

<p>“I’ve had my notice from the dread spirits that infest
the place to go! Didst thou note what dark and
threatening clouds dipped down like vultures upon me
when we were last there?” vehemently Rizpah replied.</p>

<p>“I only saw a threatening of rain that came not. It
seldom rains in the Lejah.”</p>

<p>“There was rain enough in my poor, shivering, weeping
heart!”</p>

<p>“But, I wonder, Rizpah, thou didst not tell me of
these feelings before!”</p>

<p>“I could not confide then; I was too jealous!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jealous? What a word! But of whom, me?”</p>

<p>“I can never forget that thy union with me has
made thee alien to thy people and in part neglectful of
the faith for which thou didst once fight bravely. I
can not forget that the Teutonic knight was the devotee
of a bepraised Lady Mary. I thought of this that black
day, and I felt as if those dry, grim clouds were her
frowns. It was thou, my Christian husband, who named
the Lejah, ‘Tartarus,’ and it has been such for some
time to me. Its sight has constantly burned me with
remorse! That day it seemed to me thy Mary pitied
thee and blamed me! I writhed under the thought!
I, for a moment, hated her. I felt like climbing some
height, and, club in hand with defiant curses, challenging
her right to have a finer care of thee than I have.
I’d have done it, if thou hadst not been here to laugh
at the folly of my frenzy. Ah, husband, if she is or was
all that thou dost depict her, she can not love me, and
thou must contrast us to my disparagement. I can not
forget that thou wert a Christian soldier; sworn to war
for her and her son; now thou art wedded to me, a
daughter of her and His persecutors!”</p>

<p>“Why, Rizpah, thy changing moods are appalling;
thou dost beat the magicians who conjure up the dead,
since thou dost create out of nothing the most hideous
ghosts to haunt thyself—Maya! Maya!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know ‘Maya,’ wife of Brahm, by interpretation
‘illusion.’ A myth, as a gibe, has a sharp
point, effective because so difficult to parry. But, alas,
ridicule, though it easily tear to pieces delusion, is powerless
to disperse the gloom that sits in a soul as mine.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not ridicule my Rizpah, but I would bring her
light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah? That is, resurrect the peace thou didst murder?”</p>

<p>“Show me one wound my hand has made and I’ll
abjectly beg all pardons, attempt any atonement!”</p>

<p>“Dost thou, knight, remember the ruins of the Christian
church of Saint George, at Edrei?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“And thy conversation there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that Saint George was England’s patron saint
famed for having slain the dragon which imperiled a
king’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“More thou didst say; thou didst expatiate on the
princess, saying her name was Alexandra, meaning,
‘friend of mankind’; further, thou saidst there was a
queenly woman by name, Mary, daughter of the King
of Kings, friend beyond all women of humanity, for
whom every true knight was willing to be a Saint
George.”</p>

<p>“True enough; but to what purport now is this
reminiscence?”</p>

<p>“Thou saidst Saint George was loyal to the death
to his faith, and died a martyr!”</p>

<p>“True again. What of it?”</p>

<p>“Was the Teutonic knight thinking of himself as a
martyr because wed to a Jewess? I followed thy
thoughts, though they were not all spoken. How naturally
that day thou didst tell me of thy visions which
thou hadst between Gerash and Bozrah when wounded
nigh to death. The English saint, knight, very loyal to
creed, rebuked in his dreams, by the beating of mighty
wings, the departing of his heart’s rose! Oh, why
didst thou not tell me this before it was too late! I
would have helped thee escape the ingenuous Jewess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Thou didst awaken then with dread bleeding, to find
thyself pillowed upon the bosom of a simple-hearted
loving girl; I now awaken, wounded indeed, but with
none to staunch the wounding! Why, de Griffin,
didst thou keep this secret so long? Why unfold it
now?”</p>

<p>“I’d be the Saint George of Rizpah and slay her
dragon, gloom.”</p>

<p>“Poor comfort to offer since the gloom is beyond
thy powers! Flout my mood as thou mayst; what
use? I vainly denounce it. Thou hast had thy
dream; now I’m having mine. I’ll not mock thy insights;
thou canst not by bantering jeer change mine.
My Lejah omens assure me that I’m to have a rain of
tears and more; some way thy Mary will be their
cause.”</p>

<p>“Rizpah errs; the queen I revere was a living epistle
of good will; her character the joy and inspiration of
all women, especially of those in tribulation. But
enough! Rizpah, being a Jew, should abhor the necromancy
of omens!”</p>

<p>“Jew! Ah, yes; I was once! But the valiant English
knight lured me into his Christian love and my
race’s hate. I had once the luxurious faith of a pious
girl; all feeling, all flowers; too young to reason, but
young enough to love the good and beautiful unto salvation.
The knight poisoned the blossoms before
they ripened by the acids of ridicule! There is a loss
beyond repair and a bitter memory, that of a broken
promise; under our love-star thou didst swear thou
wouldst never lightly treat my believing. Venus has
set, Mercury is rising; but wisdom brings a burning
glare. The promise that the knight failed to keep was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
made when I was, he said his idol; now I’m only his
wife!”</p>

<p>“Rizpah exchanges the glory of the rose for the bitter
gray of the wormwood.”</p>

<p>“I’m thy handiwork; now mock the result, if to do
so comforts thee.”</p>

<p>“My handiwork!”</p>

<p>“Yes, fool!”</p>

<p>“These words are awful.”</p>

<p>“I think so and I hate them; though I can not check
them. I hate my temper and even myself when in
such present moods. De Griffin, pray as thou didst
never pray before, that I do not learn to hate thee. I
pity thee, because I’ve some love left.”</p>

<p>“Pity?”</p>

<p>“Yes, when I imagine thee wriggling beneath the
malignant detestation of which I know I shall soon be
capable.”</p>

<p>“My wife, in God’s dear name, banish these moods!
They are impious, unnatural; the crisis of thy being
falsely accuses thy heart. Be calm!”</p>

<p>“Calm? ‘Be calm!’ Very good; calm me, please,
if thou canst. Oh, why didst thou make me thus?”</p>

<p>“The God of all peace forgive me if I did, Rizpah.”</p>

<p>“Thou wert the elder and shouldst have known?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That to unsettle a woman’s faith, if she be such as
I, is to let loose a bundle of blind vagaries and to
tumble her, like a drifting wreck, on unknown shores.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wife, as thou hopest for heaven and lovest our
unborn child, restrain these moods. Thou’lt mark the
one to be, with germs of all evil; for such outbursts of
mothers re-act with awful effect upon their offspring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Thou knowest how the old nurse, at Damascus, killed
a babe in an instant, merely by giving it her breast
after she had yielded to an outbreak of passion. Such
tempers hurl poison through all the being!”</p>

<p>“Alas, knight, that all this prudence ever comes just
a little too late!”</p>

<p>“What could I have done better?”</p>

<p>“Left the little maid of Harrimai’s home free from
thy enchantments and to the quiet of her people’s
state.”</p>

<p>“But I loved thee so. That atones for all.”</p>

<p>“Thou thoughtst thou lovedst, but ’twas my form
which fascinated thee, not my mind nor soul!” Rizpah’s
face became ashen pale, her eyes had a far-off
gaze and were steelly, as she began plaintively to repeat
the words, “‘<i>There were giants in the earth....
They saw the daughters of men, Adamish, that they
were fair and they took them for wives of all they chose,
and they bore children and it repented the Lord that He
had made man, for He saw that the wickedness was
great in the earth.</i>’ Thou wast my giant-lofty. Thou
stolest my heart and body. Now for a flood to punish
the sin, and my tears are already its first droppings.”</p>

<p>“We are wed; shall we not now make the best of it?
Even when into this mystic alliance unmated lives
converge, they can still with wisdom extract from it at
least peace. Go fervently, firmly, back to the faiths
of thy girlhood; become again all thou wert, except
that thou be ever mine.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! how little, after all, thou knowest of woman’s
heart? Thou wouldst command it do and be; and go
and come, wouldst thou? Thinkst thou, thou canst
make such heart as mine wild with the strange intoxications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of unholy fire, filling the brain above it with all
the clouds, weird longings, doubtings and misgivings,
that fume up from that fire, and then send that heart
back without a compass, chart, sail or helm, to find the
haven? Send it lashed by remorse part of the time,
part of the time half dead to all feeling, and all the
time blind, to hunt up lost creeds.”</p>

<p>“But God provided an ark; let us ask Him to aid us
build one in a home, with happy parents and happy
children. Thou readst to me, but yesterday, the
Prophets’ beautiful description of a lamp burning with
oil supplied from two palm trees; one on either side.
I’ll interpret; the trees are parents, the lamp the light
of home, manifest in posterity, reproduction; a prophecy
of the resurrection.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful mysticism. But the giantesque men rose
to play at lust, just beside Sinai of the law.”</p>

<p>“Not so I, the Teutonic knight, now the husband.
Rizpah; thy desperate misery appeals to all my manhood.
I swear to thee I’d turn my heart’s blood into
the oil to cause our home to glow with the serene
light of holy happiness.”</p>

<p>“Words, words; how sad, because so beautiful, yet
so vain!”</p>

<p>“Oh Rizpah,” cried the knight, too anxious to be
angry, though the woman’s words were stinging, “thy
looks startle me! Pray God to rest and hold thy worried
soul.”</p>

<p>“Pray? I have tried, often of late, to pray, but I
do not know how. I fear thou hast stolen even that
power from me! Ugh! the last time I prayed, my
words seemed like black cormorants rising with loads of
carrion; then falling struck dead by the sun, into great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
black caves, such as abound in our Lejah hell! I
heard my words flung back at me in mockery. Pray? I
dare not, lest God strike me dead for a hypocrite and a
heretic!”</p>

<p>“But my poor, dear wife,” soothingly said Sir Charleroy,
“He is merciful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to the good and the faithful; I’m neither!
I gave Him up for a man, as the Adamish men gave
him up for women. I madest thou my God, and now
have none other; for He of the heavens is very holy,
but very jealous!”</p>

<p>“Rizpah, Rizpah, do not thus give way to these wild
imaginations.”</p>

<p>“Give way? Alas, all is already given away; soul
and body were on an idolatrous altar long ago. I’m
buried in the ashes!”</p>

<p>“But Rizpah, trust my love: I’ll help thee back to
peace and usefulness.”</p>

<p>“Bah! the masculine great I——”</p>

<p>“Heavens! woman, is there any love in a heart that
so hurls javelins?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know! I suppose so, for I pity thee.”</p>

<p>“Pity me?”</p>

<p>“Yes; when I think as I do at times, that thy wife is
turning into a devil, a very devil! Sir Charleroy de
Griffin, knight of St. Mary, dost hear me? A devil, a
raging devil, and one that will pity while she assails.”
The last sentence was almost screamed, then the woman
fell on the rug of their apartment and wept convulsively.
After a little there was the silence of exhaustion, of
chagrin, of shame. Sir Charleroy stood by the prostrate
form and with words half commanding said: “Let us
ride out a little way.” He was trying a new strategy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no, no! Thou’lt take me to the Lejah, and I
shall see that dread omen again.”</p>

<p>“What?” As he questioned he raised the woman
tenderly from the floor.</p>

<p>“The lava desert, in long rolling waves, black and
drear.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Rizpah, thou knowest that it was only thy unreined
fancy, heated by morbid broodings, that changed
the eternally-fixed furrows of the plain, overshadowed
by running clouds into threatening billows! God
and the sun are above all clouds and behind every
anxious heart. Look up; look in, until thy soul finds
Him; then the horror of darkness will die away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how thy comfortings hurt me, because I do not
believe in thee, nor believe thee! Thou sayst that thou
didst abandon thy Christian, perfect queen of women,
for me. I know thou must be chagrined at the bad
exchange! I can not honor nor trust the faithfulness
of one so fickle. No matter for that, but what comes
after is worse. Those black sky-drapings were over the
Lejah that day because I was there. I know—I know
there’s a tide of sorrow rolling toward me. I see it
as I saw those black, serpent-like, lava waves. But, oh,
the suspense! It’s awful; let the worst come if only
soon!” The knight, sworn to protect helpless women,
saw himself disarmed and powerless to aid the one
woman of earth for whom he would have died.</p>

<p>Two giants at bay in Giant Land, where another
mold of gianthood had died leaving nothing but
monuments to attest the greatness of the failure. The
two knew only this, that they were very miserable and
powerless, by any means accustomed, to extricate
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Charleroy wished and wished, in his soul, that his
patron saint and queen of women would appear and
tell both what to do. He unconsciously was turning
his mind’s eye in the right direction. Husband and
wife both believed there was a right way, a pattern of
right, and an ideal of heaven, but they could not lay
hold of them. Giant, crusader and husband, each in
turn strove in his day at the same spot, and at the
same point failed.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy, in mind, went out along a strangely
beset line of thinking. Sometimes he pitied himself,
and that brought the balm of conceit. He remembered
it was a fine thing to be a martyr, forgetting that
some, rewardless, suffer as sinners. Sometimes he
heard those beatings of mighty wings, as if some wondrous
holy one were departing. Then he became very
penitent and full of the entreatings of prayer. Either
mood was brief enough to him not yet converted; a
very Peter in vacillations. Whether he would finally
follow the beating wings or sit down nigh to the gates
of certain insanity, the gates that those who over-much
pity themselves are sure to reach, was the issue in his
life then. The bugles of war call few to the heroism
of the field, but millions are daily called by God’s
bugle to the better achievements which make for glory
amid the duties of common life. That latter bugle was
calling him, but he was slow to obey, or understand
even.</p>

<p>The events recorded in the foregoing pages roused
Sir Charleroy to an anxious effort to do something to
change the currents of his wife’s thoughts. Necessity
quickened his discernment, and though he had had but
little experience in dealing with those ill in the body or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
mind, he quickly concluded that a change of place and
a change of pursuit would be beneficial. In truth, his
own feelings attested this much. He himself was weary
of the pursuit of excitement as a sole and constant
occupation.</p>

<p>“Shall we leave the Lejah, Rizpah?” he questioned,
a few days after the outbreak before mentioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, I say!—I’m leaving it! See here,” and she
pointed to her cheeks, once ruddy, now haggard. “Oh,
Charleroy, take me away or death will!”</p>

<p>“Enough! We’ll go. But where?”</p>

<p>“Any place under heaven; say the word and I’ll run
out of the place instantly, leaving all here.”</p>

<p>“What, our effects!”</p>

<p>“Any thing to get away. I feel like a child approached
by some monster terror, hour by hour! For
days I’ve been transfixed by my fear or I would have
run away, even alone, before this. Now thy words
break the spell! Come, let us go before I’m overcome
again!”</p>

<p>“There, now, be calm. No more of this undue nervousness.
We’ll go, and soon. What says Rizpah to
Bozrah, southward of Bashan?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to Bozrah; historic Bozrah!” and the face of
the woman brightened as she went on: “It was the
fairy land of my youth. I’ve wanted to go there since
I was a wee little thing, scarce able to walk.” Then
the woman unbent and talked with the rapture of a
child:</p>

<p>“Oh; I’ve wanted to see Bozrah all my life, since
the days when my old nurse used to talk me to sleep
with stories of Og and his bedstead nine cubits long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and how our little Hebrew, Moses, overcame those
Rephaim.”</p>

<p>“Thy prophets and psalmists, as well as thy nurses,
were wont to go into rapturous descriptions of the lofty
oaks, loftier mountains, ragged plains, marvelous pastures
and goodly herds of the Hauran and Trachonitis.”</p>

<p>Rizpah continued in gleeful strain: “Oh, those
herds; if I can’t see old Og, I’d like to see the famous
bulls of Bashan! Show me something huge, no matter
how huge, if alive and not black! I’m becoming infatuated
with the strong and the large. If ever I lose
my soul it will be by worshiping, pagan-like, something
mightier than I can imagine; of body or muscle.
Yes, yes, I’ll be a thorough pagan since I can not be a
Jew nor a Christian! Now, I forewarn thee.” So saying
she laughed merrily. The knight was rejoiced to
hear the musical, natural laughter again, and encouraged
the play of her wit, which attested a mind unbending
to rest.</p>

<p>“Woman-like, adoring the huge when the grand
can not be found. Thank God, the giants are all dead;
there are none at Bozrah, at least. I’ll not fear the
little dirty Arabs, or pigmy Druses as supplanters.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Passing from Edrei toward Bozrah the pilgrim
knight and his wife with their convoy
reached Kunawat, the Kenath of Scripture,
once the dwelling place of Job. Here
for a time they abode. The number and variety of
castles, temples, theaters and palaces in ruins, were
sufficient to engage the attention of the travelers for
many days. Rizpah was more cheerful than she was
at Edrei, but yet restless to reach Bozrah, on which
place her heart was set.</p>

<p>One day standing before an old Roman temple in
Kunawat, Rizpah, somewhat interested by its well preserved
Corinthian columns, and Sir Charleroy deeply
engrossed in contemplation of an huge stone image, the
former asks: “Has the knight recognized an old English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
or a new Bashan love?” The woman was finding
the oft-repeated and prolonged visits to this particular
place monotonous. She was annoyed, but modified
her rebuke into raillery.</p>

<p>“There is something very fascinating in the Cyclopean
face.”</p>

<p>“A broken stone fascinate a man? But I see ’tis
that of a woman; the brain part gone. Would that
the English knight had wed such; then he might have
been loyal to creed, and not a martyr!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/astarte.jpg" width="400" height="475" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ASTARTE.</p>
</div>

<p>“Rizpah knows that I could never have loved a
brainless face, nor any one akin to this Kunawat
goddess.”</p>

<p>“Not if she echoed thy ‘aye’ and ‘nay’ consistently?
Be careful; as many strong men have fallen by
having their conceit gratified as there have fallen
women through flattery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“How absurd to hint that I could be so lured.”</p>

<p>“But the knight says Astarte fascinates!”</p>

<p>“I said so, meaning that I’m fascinated by the
train of thoughts that the image awakens. Think a
moment; we, the living of to-day confronting the
acme of the thought of the ages long gone. Looking
at this, I seem to be seeing over rolling centuries, right
into the hearts of humanity that lived thousands of
years ago.”</p>

<p>“All this might have been taken in at a glance!
Having seen it, what use is it?”</p>

<p>“Use? To aid in finding a key to life’s problems.
I’m filled with questionings; do not yearnings, such as
beat through the being of the ancients pulse in those
of to-day? Are not humanity’s temptations and needs
ever the same?”</p>

<p>“Since the ancients did not tarry to compare with
us, I, being only a woman, of Gerash, of to-day, can
give only the shallow answer, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not questioning Rizpah; but the ruins, the
air, time, my soul, God!”</p>

<p>“And their reply?”</p>

<p>“Bewildering echoes of each question?</p>

<p>“And it’s all a mystery to Sir Charleroy?”</p>

<p>“I know a little; something, next to nothing.”</p>

<p>“Possess curious me of that little, and I’ll help thee
wonder why so much greatness came to naught.”</p>

<p>“That wondering is easily met; they had, as god, one
whose head could be broken as this one’s was; they
that would survive must be sheltered by the Invincible.”</p>

<p>Rizpah, meanwhile had drawn close to the huge stone
face and placing one hand beneath the mouth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
other on the portion of the head just above the moon
crown, her arms stretched well nigh to their limits
quizically remarked:</p>

<p>“Those that dined with her must have had pyramids
for chairs. What dost thou think they were like?”</p>

<p>“Crusaders?”</p>

<p>“Now, I’m tantalized. Crusaders two or three
thousand years ago? How absurd!”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly they were not known by the name,
Crusaders: but they that followed Astarte and such-like
deities, whether called Kenaihites, Rephaim, Moslem,
Christians, or by other appellation are all soldier-pilgrims,
dominated by an ideal. There have been
many female deities among the pagans and there is a
deal of paganism left in humanity.”</p>

<p>“That’s because half the race are men. Astarte
would be very popular to-day with thy sex, if she were
here in living form, a whole woman, instead of a fragment
and beautiful also—”</p>

<p>“Thou dost not care to hear more of the female
deities?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I’ll be fearfully jealous if thou dost
keep any thing back. Tell me what madmen the
ancients were?” She paused, slapped the face of the
image, ejaculating “<i>Virago!</i>” then continued, “Why
did they make their effigy both hideous and huge?
Ugly things should be dwarfed!”</p>

<p>“The ancients, who knew not the grandeur of moral
power, gave their deities terribleness in their physical
proportions, and a mountain of flesh became their ideal
of greatness—men ever try to make their objects of
worship greater than themselves, thou knowest. Hast
forgotten what Ichabod once told us of the Egyptians?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
How they expressed their reverence by piling up pyramids
and made that very diminutive which they would
caricature? Oh, how our true religion, having at its
heart an only, all-beautiful, Almighty God, rises above
these human devices!”</p>

<p>“I wonder that it did not, at its first appearing on
earth, instantly overthrow all others.”</p>

<p>“And it is a still more wonderful thing that those
who embraced it, having known, should have sometimes
gone back to paganism? Thou dost remember that
God’s chosen people, after enjoying marvels of His
Providence, plunged headlong into idolatry in the very
presence of His splendor at Sinai?”</p>

<p>“With shame I remember it. I marvel as well that
this record, which evokes the ridicule of the grosser
heathen, was made part of our Holy writings.”</p>

<p>“God’s compensation! The people stripped themselves
of their jewels to make the calf; then of their
garments to worship it according to the lewd rites of
Apis. God since has lashed them naked around the
world, as it were, by giving their history to all times.
‘<i>Be sure your sin will find you out</i>,’ is a stern truth
haunting the conscience of the evil doer; but though
exposure is a bitter medicine it is a saving one. God
as such applies it.”</p>

<p>“I think the devil crazed the people at Sinai.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rizpah, but Human Desire was his name.
The revelers made their devil as well as their calf,
that day.”</p>

<p>“But it is said ‘they rose to play.’ If so disobedient
and heaven-defying how could they have found
heart to play?”</p>

<p>“Odious, significant word that one is, here. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a ‘<i>play</i>’ that engulphed all purity. No wonder they
ceased to observe the ‘burning mountain!’ Only the
pure in heart can see God.”</p>

<p>“Thank God! that thy people and mine have finally
escaped, my husband.”</p>

<p>“So far as we have escaped, I thank Him; but, alas,
the evangels of Egypt’s scarlet heresies still go about,
and there are many, everywhere, led away in chains that
seem of flowers at first, but are found to be of galling
iron at last.”</p>

<p>“I did not know this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, these modern perverters disguise their horrible
tenets with many refined phrases; yet He that overwhelmed
gross Sodom and the jewelless, naked dancers
about the golden bull, sees through all their thin drapings
and will judge the free lover, corrupt socialist and
libertine as He did those ancients. The Assyrian and
Egyptian representations of Venus generally appeared
holding a serpent; a sort of bitter admission of the
curse in the hand of perverted love and the fierce lashings
that follow it.”</p>

<p>“I fail to connect the ancient with the present heresies,
my good teacher.”</p>

<p>“I pause to-day here, reminded of their common
origin and consequences. God put it into the hearts
of His creatures to love women, honor motherhood,
and worship Him. Read Sinai’s law, and this is all
manifest. There came a perversion; the love of woman
was degraded, motherhood was denied its honor, and
men became God-defying. There was a confusion
worse than that of Babel, and the worshiping was
transferred, first, to symbolized lust; then degraded.
They that adored Venus, knowing how her adoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
had depraved themselves, came to believe that she scandalized
the heaven they imagined. Then came a time
when her earthly rites even scandalized the wiser
pagans.”</p>

<p>“My husband leads me along strange ways. Is it
wise to do so?”</p>

<p>“I see a grand end; follow me. There is a deep
significance in the fact that among the pagans there
constantly appeared this adoration of woman on
account of her power of motherhood. I take this
adoration as proof of a conscious need feeling after a
vaguely discerned truth. The yearning is suggested by
the paired gods. Assyria had its Beltis, consort of
Bel-nimrud; and there were Allelta of the Arabians,
the many-breasted Diana of the Ephesians, the Aphrodite
of the Greeks, Ceres and Venus of Rome, this
Astarte of the Giants; beyond all, in utter odiousness
Khem, the Phallic god of Egypt. Amid all these false
ideals, the divine home with its pure love and our immortality
by grace’s mystery, were overslaughed in human
thought. The glaring passions, that were unwilling
to believe in other immortality than that that comes
through posterity, other heaven than that of sensuous
pleasure, fascinated and dominated hearts and souls.”</p>

<p>“And worshiping women-gods did this.”</p>

<p>“Worshiping beings with the form of women did
it! Reverence for true womanhood ever exalts and
never degrades. But these ancients adored very gorgons
with snakes for hair, and having tearing, brazen
claws. They set these gorgons with the Harpies, in
their mythologies, at the gates of dark Pluto’s palace.
Alas, where men are led by ill-flavored women, is ever
more Pluto’s gateway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“The up-digging of these ancient soils, knight, give
forth foul odors. Did they not dread a just and jealous
God?”</p>

<p>“No. It is the constant voice of history that false
belief concerning these things of which I have spoken,
brings both blindness and degradation. Unbelief comes
swiftly in the wake of impurity. The gorgons had but
one eye and that had the malign power of turning to
stone all upon whom its glance fell. When men deify
a fallen woman then look for a cataclysm of evils. Rizpah
has seen little of the world, but this in time she’ll
find true; the man whose cult or faith bends toward
the libidinous is on the way to utter atheism. So these
old-time free-lovers, like those of to-day, push out
of the universe in their belief, the Great, Beautiful,
First Cause. The pure in heart see God; the impure
can not even pray to Him. The latter must be aided
by an Immaculate One. They make a gulf betwixt their
souls and heaven, which Great Mercy alone can bridge.”</p>

<p>“Ah, knight, I’d dread a return of those gross idolatries,
knowing mankind’s trend, but that I knew that
Shiloh was to come as a Reformer.” The knight
caught at the words of his wife to lead her toward his
own dear belief.</p>

<p>“If He came to Rizpah in the form of a man, unique
because of his virgin purity, unlike any other in being
all unselfish, and accompanied by a peerless woman,
exemplifying all that is best in the gentle sex; between
Himself and that woman a love deep to love’s last depth,
pure as a sunbeam, enduring as eternity itself, would
Rizpah welcome Him!”</p>

<p>“That would be a wondrous coming; but I’d welcome
Him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does Rizpah believe such an appearing desirable?”</p>

<p>“Oh, on my soul, yes! If he should so come, methinks
the rites which have gone on in the secrecy of
the groves, under the uncertain light of the moon, would
be driven from the earth, and men come to worship
God, taking that man for the ideal of manhood, that
woman as woman’s pattern.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou see that stone with eight lines crossing,
lying just there by the image of Astarte?”</p>

<p>“I see it and the lines; but what of them?”</p>

<p>“In the far East, the land of the Fire Worshipers,
on almost all the handiwork of man that symbol is
placed. It is to represent an eight-pointed star, the
Assyrian sign of immortality.”</p>

<p>“Eight lines crossing to represent immortal life?
This is inane!”</p>

<p>“Not quite. I had its explanation from my wandering
Jew, Ichabod, learned by much travel in the lore
of many peoples. He thus interpreted the symbol
as the Assyrians understood it; man, a four-pointed
star; his four radiate limbs suggesting that likeness.
Thou knowest that the Israelites have been wont to call
men stars? The Assyrians, not having the sure word,
were led to seek by human philosophy a theory of
immortality, and they got no further than twice four,
two human beings in union; so eight or a double
star, their symbol of marriage, represented the only
immortality they were able to find; that that comes
from reproduction. At least that was the only reality,
the rest being very vaguely believed, and believed only
because they thought that the mystery of a new life
coming forth, was a hint of a spiritual method analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to the material. They then fell to worshiping the
sun, the great fructifier and light of nature; fire, the
essence of passion, became their highest god. It is
said that those Magi of the East, that arrived long ago
at Bethlehem, were fire worshipers, and that in answer
to a cry for light, constantly uttered by their race, they
took their journey to Judah, seeking it.”</p>

<p>“The world must turn to Israel ever for the truth,
Sir Charleroy.”</p>

<p>“For some truth; not all; but there is a tradition
that the star the wise men followed was a double one,
two planets in conjunction. There is a fitness in the
legend, for the seekers of light were brought to the cave
where lay a mother and babe; the latter God’s finest
presentment of immortality, the Incarnation; the fruit
of the Divine in union with the human. I stand overcome
with wonder and reverence when I remember
that they of the East had some light from the Jews
they held captive ages before. They lost most of what
they had, then, longing for its return, God answered
their prayer by taking them to the finest of schools, a
blessed home circle. Behold all the East looking for
light at Bethlehem!”</p>

<p>Rizpah evaded her husband’s graceful attempt to
impress on her Christian tenets, by replying: “I prefer
the Jewish choice number Seven, though I can not give
it fine interpretations, as thou to the Eight of the East.”</p>

<p>“Rizpah prefers it because it is Jewish, and I prefer
Seven because I read therein a covenant; for Seven is
the sacred covenant number of God’s Word. Let me
interpret: There is a Triune God, symbolized by
Three; then man, the child of chance, the being tossed
hither and thither by the four winds, a complex union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
himself of body, mind, animal life and immortal spirit.
Four is his representative number, or symbol. The
Assyrians paired fours; the Jews vaguely discerned a
grander path to eternal felicity through the conjunction
of God and man, the Three and the Four.
From this they derived their covenant number,
Seven.”</p>

<p>“These are charming explanations, Sir Charleroy;
especially so, if sure ones!”</p>

<p>“But the truths are fairer than my poor words. I
read that at creation the morning stars—meaning the
beings that know no night, the very sons of God—shouted
for joy! They saw an immortality having its
springs in the being of the Eternal, and were glad.
Since then the race has diverged into two lines. The
gross and unbelieving, seeking to effect the apotheosis
of human lust, have gone their ways reveling under the
moonlight, and building their fanes in the groves
which fade, while the believing and God-taught have
walked in a covenant toward Him, ‘Who only hath immortality
dwelling in light.’ Rizpah, some day that
home group at Bethlehem, a father, mother, and child,
surrounded by angels, overshadowed by God, will come
to be thought the finest ideal of this life. Yea, a picture
of Heaven itself!”</p>

<p>The knight’s wife fixed her piercing, dark eyes on his,
there were expressed in her countenance admiration
and fearfulness. She was charmed by his lofty sentiments,
yet apprehensive of being led into some dangerous,
Christian heresy. Fanaticism always has a
terror of heresy, so-called, even though it seemed to
be full of white truth. Presently she questioned:</p>

<p>“So Og, great as a mountain of flesh, and Astarte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
goddess of the pleasure that kills, only, of all Kunawat’s
ancients, have left enduring names?”</p>

<p>“One other name endures, the ages brightening its
luster—Job, loyal to the last, in spite of the devil and
a virago wife.”</p>

<p>“Poor woman! say I of Job’s wife. None have told
her side of her family troubles. May be Job haunted
the grove of the moon-crowned?”</p>

<p>“May be? Never! His splendid orations bespoke
a man walking nigh Jehovah. Listen: ‘If I beheld the
moon walking in brightness, if my heart hath been
secretly enticed, or my mouth kissed my hand, let
thistles grow instead of wheat.’ He said this amid
the votaries of the Lust-Queen.”</p>

<p>“And Job may be praised, not only as proof that
there has been one patient man on earth, but as proof
that a good man will stand pure to the last, though the
world about acclaim the praise of delightful sins?”</p>

<p>“He stood because entranced by his beautiful ideal.
He loved Him whose name is Holiness.”</p>

<p>“Heaven comes at last to such.”</p>

<p>“Job was God’s best friend on earth in his day, and
his Heavenly Father gave him as his reward His best
earthly gift—a new, pure, happy, fruitful home.”</p>

<p>“Are we through now with the fascinating image,
knight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rizpah, if we take to heart its warnings. May
we preserve our integrity, and have a home as our reward
finer than that of the Man of Uz; yea, verily, as
fine in its tempers and virtues as that of Bethlehem.”</p>

<p>So saying, the knight led Rizpah toward their abode.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Sir Charleroy and his consort took up
their abode in one of the many deserted
ancient stone houses of the city of Bozrah.
The latter, situated in one of the most
fertile plains of earth, once having upward of one
hundred thousand inhabitants, several times having
risen to metropolitan splendor, ages ago sank into
neglect, decay and desolation. But with wonderful
persistence that city preserves the records, or relics, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
what it was in better, greater days. The antiquarian
to-day finds in and around Bozrah the dwellings,
palaces and temples of many and various peoples,
some piled in strata-like courses, one above the other,
each layer the tombstone of its predecessor; some
as fine as they were forty centuries ago. The
annalist there has at hand as an open book the
achievements of some of the mightiest men of earth,
physically. The latter were contemporary with that
line of God’s moral giants, of which Abraham, Moses
and David were representative leaders first, and Christ
finally. The strata of Bozrah tell of differing policies,
politics, religions; all alike in one thing—the attempt
to build upon the buttresses of giant force; but they
present in the end the one result—failure; all being
equally dead at the last, if not equally herculean at
the first. Sheer robustness in the armies of Rome,
the Turk, Alexander, and Og wrought out their best
about the Bashan cities, and in that theater played
the eternally losing game of all such. It seems as if
God had chosen that part of all the world to illustrate
this great lesson of His providence. The Roman,
Mohammedan, Greek, and others like them, there had
their brutal and sensuous existence. There the Crusader
carried also his banners; but the end of the
Rephaim was the forerunner and prophecy of all the
other giantesque gatherings that followed after them.
Each passing race and dynasty left its monuments
and tokens of possession; but of all, those of the
first, the giants, are the most enduring, most wonderful.
These dateless, huge, rugged, fort-like dwellings,
standing just as they did four thousand years ago, except
that they are mostly unoccupied, are impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
monuments and reminders of the mighty denizens
who once abode within them. There are ruins of
temples, palaces, houses of commerce and places of
amusement, but chiefly of homes; the latter, significantly,
instructively, being the best preserved of
all. Sir Charleroy observed this circumstance, and
casually remarked to Rizpah, as they bestowed their
effects in one of the ancient domiciles:</p>

<p>“If ever I take to building, I’ll build abiding places
for people, only. Such are the most lasting.”</p>

<p>But while he came thus near to a royal truth, he did
not make it his own. It passed through his mind and
he felt its light, as one might that from the wing of a
ministering spirit, while his eyes were holden and his
back turned. He immediately left the angelic thought,
to go wandering through years of misery, before coming
back face to face with it again. Sir Charleroy and
Rizpah, a western soldier and a woman of Israel, two
giants in their way, began a new career at Bozrah. It
was providential. Measuring power by the only available
test at hand, namely, what it accomplishes, it was
manifest long ago to all that the brawn of the Cyclops
was not the master force of the word. Hercules
cleansed the earth of mythical, not real evils. Sir
Charleroy and Rizpah are fittingly brought to the theater
of the giants for the purpose of testing the potency
of giantesque sentimentality and stubborn, mighty
ardor. To this end, two will do as well as a nation,
and a decade will be as conclusive as a score of generations.
The husband and wife entered Bozrah gladly,
and quickly adapted themselves to their new surroundings.
They were both very impressible, and there
were many things in their new environments that impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and stimulated them. Nature’s face and locations
may be changed by man, but he can not change
her heart. She, on the other hand, is invincible in her
conquests of both his face and inner being. Climate
and environments determine the characters and careers
of the majorities. The sleets of the North, in time,
will goad the sensuous Turk or Hottentot to high
activity, while the Cossack or Esquimaux, under tropical
suns soon fall into luxuriousness and laziness. Bozrah
began its molding of the knight and his wife.
Rizpah and Sir Charleroy were at first attracted to
Giant Land by the hugeness of its monuments and
ghostly greatness of its record. They received at Bozrah
their first impulse to settle and make a home.
Probably they were largely influenced by the conviction
that, in its way, there was nothing more
entrancing or majestic beyond. For the best results
to them, the second selection was altogether unfortunate.
They had made their home in the midst of
battle-fields, and the atmosphere that hung over all
things was like that over a defeated army, sullenly submitting.
The new comers from the beginning, in their
new home, were immersed in ghostly memories, and
that atmosphere so like the breath of a bound yet
struggling giant. They were affected more than they
realized by all these things.</p>

<p>“No more tours, no more worlds, for us to conquer!”
exclaimed the knight.</p>

<p>Rizpah, her cheerfulness of mind largely recovered,
replied to this remark of Sir Charleroy with a bantering
laugh, at the same time pointing upward.
Quickly, and with retort cruel as a giant’s javelin, he
cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas, so soon Rizpah seeks my final departure
from her!”</p>

<p>The cavalier was no more; it was the brusque and
gross within him that spoke. Had he been courtly, even
without being Christian, he would have been considerate
enough not to have cruelly jested concerning that
which lay in his wife’s heart as a possible and sad fact.
Often the thought of eternal separation from her husband,
even from eternal hope, haunted her now.
Her husband knew this.</p>

<p>For a moment his answer seemed to stun her; then
the affectations of pouting on her mobile face, coming
when she pointed upward, changed into lines of anger.
A hot flush mounting up to the roots of her hair, hung
out the warning signal.</p>

<p>The knight, pretending not to observe the change,
twined his arms about his wife and mockingly sighed:</p>

<p>“Poor girl! I can find no wings on thee. I once
thought thou hadst such. They must have dropped
off.”</p>

<p>There was no reply. He then began to retreat, to
placate, and to that intent drew her closer and closer
to his heart, until, embracing her, his hands clasped;
but, for the first time since the event near Gerash,
when the Arabs were vanquished, his caress was without
response. He tried a thrust thus:</p>

<p>“Well, beloved, since thou dost banish me, bestow
a kiss of long farewell.”</p>

<p>Quickly, Rizpah flung aside his embracing arms and
cried: “Shechemite! I’m no Dinah, won by false
professions!”</p>

<p>“<i>Shechem was more honorable than all the house of his
father</i>,” quoted the knight in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“He loved himself, his passions; to these gods he
gave up with all devotion, and they immolated him.
That was good!”</p>

<p>“Why, Rizpah, thou art pettish.”</p>

<p>“‘Rizpah!’ Thou art adroit in using bitter similes; a
brutalizing power, when brutally used! Now, call me
‘Jarnsaxa.’ Thou toldst me, yesterday, how that
mighty male god of the Norse, Thor, while hating her
people, to the death, stole Jarnsaxa. Yea, and how
many giants fell for women. Perhaps thou didst want
me to pity thee. We are in Giant Land now, and thou
canst begin to play Colossus!”</p>

<p>The knight was startled, and quickly entreated:
“My queen, lets drop the masks; no more of this;
forget my sarcasm, and I’ll forgive the recriminations.
A truce and pardon, in the name of love. What says
Esther?”</p>

<p>“‘Esther?’ Thou calledst me that when cavalier,
turning lover. Thou art neither now!” The sentence
ended in a petulant sob.</p>

<p>“Oh, stay now. It was playfulness. I—there, now!
Canst thou not brook a little playfulness from me?”</p>

<p>“Playfulness? Bah! Ye men play so like lions,
forgetting to keep the claws cushioned! But, now
thou hadst better be going, saint—the only one here.
Go, now, right along to heaven. They want thee there.
They want thee, not me.” Then she choked back
another sob, but instantly thereafter, dashing the rising
tear from her eyes, she bitterly exclaimed: “At any
rate, thou’lt have company!”</p>

<p>“Whom, pray?”</p>

<p>“The begetter and chief of all restless vagabonds!”</p>

<p>“So; I never heard of him. Has he a name, my dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The knight was sarcastic, because he was nettled.</p>

<p>Rizpah’s eyes glittered with the fire of offended
pride, and she quickly began in measured tone, as if in
soliloquy, and alone, to quote Job’s record of satan’s
joining the assembly of the sons of God:</p>

<p>“<i>There was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the Lord, and satan came also.
And the Lord said whence camest thou? Then satan
said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking
up and down in it.</i>”</p>

<p>“My wife responds to my penitence with bitterness;
but even the pagans were wiser. They ever took the
gall from the animals offered to Juno, goddess of wedlock.”</p>

<p>“Thy wife promised to be thy helpmate and give
thee all she had. Now, just forget thy fine paganism,
being a Christian long enough to remember that I’m
thy helpmate in all things, even in bitterness. I give
thee all, even returning thy giving.”</p>

<p>“Thou shouldst not make so much of my little misstep.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is little with which one must constantly
live. Great breaks grow from little fractures. One
may stand a blow, but its the constant fretting that
roughs the heart-strings to woe unendurable. Thou
hast a habit of playfully hurting.”</p>

<p>“Well, this has been a day at school; there ought to
be a school for husbands! We do not half understand
the fine, sensitive creatures that companion us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thou thoughtst thou wert a woman-reader!”</p>

<p>“Were I to see an angel with a body like a harp,
eyes like the unsearchable ocean, heart of flame, arms
like flowering vines, covered with prismatic wings, I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
be no more puzzled and abashed than I am now by
my high-strung, fine-tempered Rizpah.”</p>

<p>“Puzzled! abashed! I’d help thee pity thy wounded
conceit, but that I know that thou art soon to ascend.
Art thou going now!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, since I’ve so many more sins than
graces. When elephants soar with butterfly wings,
thou mayst look for my departure. Till then I’ll stay
here and practice the patience of Job, beset with his
rambling devil.”</p>

<p>“How elegantly the cavalier uses simile in coining
epithets.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! Rizpah, thou dost twist my meanings!
Why distort, instead of pardoning my blunders, making
both of us miserable!”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, thou hast grace enough not to liken me
to thy besetting, evil spirit, at least in words?”</p>

<p>“No, no, ’tis refined cruelty to put me on the defense
as to that. Believe it or not, Rizpah of Gerash
and Rizpah of Bozrah are the same. My heart to its
core says so!”</p>

<p>This second quarrel, that should not have been begun,
had the merit of ending, as it should, in reconciliation,
tears, embraces and a great many excellent
pledges. Yet Sir Charleroy did not greatly profit by
the experience. He failed to perceive that these first
breaks in the rhythmic flow of conjugal love are great
shocks to a deeply affectionate woman. He knew that
men easily recover from rebuffs, and so did not stop to
consider that young wife-hood was the highest expression
on earth of utter clinging to one sole support.
He knew his own feelings and took them for the standard.
He set himself up as the pattern, quite unconsciously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
perhaps; and after the conflict in which he
came off conceded victor, he was condescending in his
manner. This was unfortunate. Rizpah did not need
to be told that her husband was wiser and stronger
willed and more self-possessed and more able to endure
life’s trial than herself. All this she believed, absolutely,
when she surrendered her heart to the man at
the first. Woman-like, these were the very circumstances
that caused her to love him as she did. A
woman never loves completely until her love is supplemented
by adoration. She must believe the man, who
would make full conquest, is one to whom she can
look up; one some way her superior. But while a
loving woman will give a devotion almost religious, she
will be pained amid her delights of committal by a
haunting fear that he whom she adores may rise away
from her. In the very plenitude of her fullest love-worship
she will deny the reverence, sometimes, in a
seeming inconsistency, rebuff and even ridicule her
idol. It is with her a sort of hysteria, a confession of
secret terror, lest she and he grow apart in mind, and
so come to part in body. Hence it is a giant cruelty
on the part of a husband, sometimes, to enforce, or
thrust forward, his size or his lordship. They may be
facts, but God has set over against them as their equal
that love which clings, stimulates and supplements,
without which the finest man is far less than the half
of the united twain. Sir Charleroy blundered along
in his error; Rizpah tried to be happy and failed.
She did not know how to make the best of her surroundings,
and Sir Charleroy did not know, because he
did not seek religiously to find out how to help her
make the best of them. They had some periods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
pleasure, but they continually grew briefer and were
more frequently interrupted as time went on. She was
ill, he suffered himself to think her at times ill-tempered.
As a lover, he admired her outbreaks as very
brilliant, and flattered her by remarking that she had
the metal of an Arabian steed; as a husband, he thought
her very disagreeable when pettish or angry. Indeed,
though he never said so to her, he did say to himself that
at times she was very like a virago. The only steed
that came to his mind then was the ass, to which he
likened himself when he considered himself the perfection
of submissive patience.</p>

<p>A new event radically changed the picture and situation
in this troubled home.</p>

<p>The prayer of prayers was heard in Bozrah; the cry
of a baby; a bundle of needs and helplessness, with no
language but a cry. Processions of silent centuries had
passed through those halls since they echoed the hoarse
voices of the brawny beings who built them. One
could not hear the infant cry without remembering the
contrasts. A baby; a puny one at that, and of the
gentler sex, besides being of a race pigmy compared to
the stalwarts who builded those abodes. Sir Charleroy
and his consort had set up their household gods, and for
a goodly period had occupied as theirs a Rephaim
home.</p>

<p>The little stranger came, though they did not discern
it, with power to bless them both. A poetic visitor,
happening on this baby’s hammock there and then,
might have gone in raptures, to some truths, after this
fashion: “It will be the golden tie, angel of peace and
hope, to the home!” The philosopher, seeing the
little bundle of helplessness, might have said: “Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
is a giant, the home is immortal through its offspring;
the babe requiring so much, richly repays its loving
care-takers by inducting them into the soul expansions
of unselfish service.” But then poets and philosophers
often miss the mark, attempting prophesy.</p>

<p>The parents followed the usual course of those for
the first time in that relation. Their love for each
other, very intense, and by its sensitiveness witnessing
after all that it was very selfish, got a new direction.
They soon drifted into the charming fooleries of their
like. Sometimes they petted the child unceasingly,
and one was anon jealous of the other if surpassed in
this. They each struggled for a recognition from the
innocent, and debated as to whether the first babble of
the little one was “mamma” or “papa.” Then there
were times when they handled baby very reverently,
as if it were something from God, or likely to
break.</p>

<p>At such times they each, in heart, thanked God and
gave the child, at least in part, to Him. Sometimes
they called it “Davidah” or “darling,” and laughed
as they assured each other, to assure themselves, that
the baby looked wise as if understanding. Sometimes
they played with it as if they were children and it a
toy; sometimes they ministered to it with anxious
care, while all the time they felt quite sure it was somehow
of finer mold and fiber than any babe before on
earth. They were just like all for the first time parents,
and their raptures were now for good, being centered
around the thought expressed by the sweet word
home. Of course, the question of naming the child
was discussed, and, of course, no name they could think
of seemed quite good enough. Some days the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was given a dozen, and some days it had none; for all
the time they kept trying to fit it.</p>

<p>In one thing, both parents were Jewish, namely, the
desire to give their darling an appellation expressive
of what it was or what they hoped it would be. They
first agreed on “Angela,” but that was discarded as
being a sort of advertisement of the quality of their
treasure. In the constant selfishness of love they
would keep it all secretly, sacredly to themselves, they
said. They sought for many days some significant
token or name that should be fully expressive of their
thought, and yet by the three only be ever fully understood.
One day Rizpah, always abrupt, still nursing an
old superstition, said: “Call her Marah, a mournful,
sweet, expressive title.”</p>

<p>“Why, wife, that means ‘bitterness.’”</p>

<p>“Bitterness, since I believe that somewhere, somehow,
there is bitterness enough in store for her—and
me with her.”</p>

<p>“I’d prefer ‘Mary,’ my wife; surely this little angel
is to be all like that blessed one.”</p>

<p>Then there was more strife, but of a rather patient
kind, which ended in a compromise, they calling the
child Miriamne, each in mind meaning different from
the other; the one Marah, the other Mary. But on
the heels of this came soon the graver problem, How
should the babe be reared, in Jewish faith or Christian?
It was the old, old story of a difficulty seemingly easily
adjusted to all, except to those who have actually met
it, and in this case, as usual, the two parties fanatically
opposed each other. In the name of sweet religion
they loyally served the devil for a time. The highest
achievement of a creed or faith is the soothing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
elevation of a home here, or the exalting of it heavenward
for hereafter. That is a travesty of piety which
wrecks the substance of joy for the shell of a dogma.
This stricture is easily written and may pass without
dissent, the reader immediately falling into the error
denounced. Of course, as usual, these two parents
began the discussion of the subject. At intervals they
cautiously pressed their arguments, but each unwaveringly
moved toward his or her point. They were like
advancing armies, firing occasional shots, but surely
approaching a mighty issue. They pretended to argue
the matter by times, but it was a farce, for each in
mind irrevocably had predetermined the conclusion.
Time sped on a year or more, then the conflict fully
came.</p>

<p>“Rizpah, we were wed by a Christian, let us take
the fruit of that compact to Christian baptism.”</p>

<p>“The first act was an error; we shall not atone for
it by repetitions in kind! The child is mine; I decline.”</p>

<p>“And mine, so I request.”</p>

<p>“A mother imperils her whole life for her child, and
unreservedly gives to it part of herself; justice, humanity,
should give the child to the mother, so far as
may be.”</p>

<p>“But even under thy faith, I, the father, am the
head of the house.”</p>

<p>“Under my faith the nurture and training of children
belong chiefly to the mother, and my faith has
been the finest society-builder of the world in the past.
Thou hast often recounted to me the deeds of that
golden, heroic time of my people, when the great Maccabean
family led us and inspired us. Well, then, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
mothers had exclusive control of the daughters until
they were wed, and so they had grand daughters among
the Maccabees.”</p>

<p>“Well, we differ in belief; we had better compromise.”</p>

<p>“We dare not barter a little soul to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, briefly then, being lord of this home, I command
that the grace-giving sacrament be sought for
our Mary.”</p>

<p>“My faith, to which thou didst first appeal, forbids
fathers to command their children to walk through
idolatrous fires. Marah shall not.”</p>

<p>“Hush; I only want the loved one inducted into
the true faith.”</p>

<p>“Mine is the older and truer.”</p>

<p>“With thee argument is futile; I insist——”</p>

<p>“If the father is a foreigner, Jewry’s rule is that the
children are to be called by the mother’s name and
regarded as of her family. Make such law as thou
choosest for thy family but not for mine.”</p>

<p>“I’ll end this,” cried Sir Charleroy, seizing the child,
as if to hasten then to seek some priest’s ministry.</p>

<p>Rizpah’s eyes glittered with sullen purpose. She
sprang before him, and hissed:</p>

<p>“Our fathers escaped at all cost from Egypt. I’ll
not go back, nor Marah.”</p>

<p>The knight was surprised, and his looks expressed it
as he said:</p>

<p>“Dost thou rave?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I was just remembering that a bearded
serpent was the Egyptian symbol of deity; something
like a man. You Christians would have all husbands
gods to their families! No bearded serpent for mine!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens, woman! thinkest thou thy scorn and vituperation
can stay me?” So saying he pushed, or
rather half flung the woman from him. He had no
conception of the rage that any thing like a blow
evokes in the heart of a woman that could love as once
did Rizpah. On his part it was intended as a masterpiece
of strategy, in the hope that the woman would
swoon, then surrender in the weakness of following
hysteria. The act was hateful to him, but he justified
it by the end sought, yet missed that end.</p>

<p>Rizpah was a tigress roused, and like many another
mother, beast or human, when the fight is once for
offspring was endowed with sudden, supernatural
strength. She sprang toward the hammock, plucking
her dagger meanwhile from its hiding-place.</p>

<p>“Heaven defend us, woman!” cried Sir Charleroy,
glancing about for a means of prevention, “thou
wouldst not do murder?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thou art not fit to die; but hear me; this
blade, consecrated to defense from dishonor, saved me
once. Dost thou remember? It will do it again, if
need be. The giver sleeps, but his stern charge haunts
me still. ‘Protect at any cost from dishonor!’”</p>

<p>“Wouldst thou shed blood of any here!”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy saw me slay the Turk. Had I failed,
thou falling, this blade would have found my own
heart. Push me onward by thy imperiousness and I
will slay the babe and then myself! Methinks, it
would be an atonement for which my parent would forgive
my breaking of his heart. Ah, then sweet rest;
life’s tumults over! God would pity the tempest-tossed
soul that, through such bitterness, flung itself
on Him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dost mean all this, Rizpah?”</p>

<p>“Can I trifle? Ask thyself. Have I ever? My
desperate sincerity made me thy wife, but now it impels
me to defy all thy attempts to make me thy minion,
unthinking echo or slave; or worse, the ruiner of
that girl.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, woman, since thou or I must yield and
I can not, thou wilt not, I execute my before announced
purpose to have my lawful authority acknowledged
with thee or——”</p>

<p>“Say the rest, find peace away from me——”</p>

<p>“Which?” sternly demanded the knight.</p>

<p>“As thou dost wish, only I’ll not give up my child
to Christian sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“Then we can not live in peace together.”</p>

<p>“To which I reply, that God never ordained marriage
to bind people to the home when they can only
for each other in that home make a very Tartarus!”</p>

<p>The knight was humiliated. He had believed that
the woman’s heart could not bear the thought of separation,
and now to find her willing to give him up,
rather than her will, her faith, hurt his pride. But
they had made an utter crossing of purposes. He ran
out of their stone house, his heart as stony. A little
way off he paused, looked back, and said, “For the last
time, Rizpah, what dost thou say?”</p>

<p>“Go; once for love I gave up all. Again I do it; I
give thee up for the highest of all love, the love of a
mother for her child!”</p>

<p>Caressingly Rizpah embraced the infant; and then
fell on her knees with her face averted from her husband.
He took one glance, and realizing the defeat of
his strong will by that kneeling woman, angrily hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
away. The die was cast. He turned his back on Rizpah,
swearing that he would never more return.</p>

<p>For a few days Rizpah lived in a crazy dream; now
laughing as she thought of her victory; again letting
her maiden love re-assert itself; then assuring her heart
that all was over and well as it was. But a woman who
imagines that reproach or even open violence can utterly
extirpate love that once completely possessed her,
knows not her own heart. Especially is this true if to
that heart, she at times, press, lovingly, a child begotten
in that love, and the form bearing the impress of
that man for whom sometime she would have willingly
died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One night the baby cried piteously, being ill, and
Rizpah was feeling very lonely because so anxious for
it. She had sometimes, since Sir Charleroy’s departure,
prattled with the baby calling “papa” and “Charleroy,”
mother-like, woman-like. Self-condemning, for
this was a half confession that she would have the
little one think, if it thought at all, that she, the
mother, was not to blame for the absence. The baby
had caught some names and in its moaning, feverishly
cried: “Abbaroy, Abbaroy; I want my Abbaroy.” The
cry was piercing to the mother’s heart and conscience.
She even then wished for the husband’s return. Indeed,
some hot tears fell as she prayed God to send
“papa Charleroy back.” The tie of marriage, potent
beyond all of earth, now drew her away toward the
absent one, and she then began to marvel how easily
they had separated; how lightly they had regarded
the bonds which after all tightly held them. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
lives have blended and been tied together by other
lives, it is indeed a prophesy of union “until death do
us apart.”</p>

<p>“Abbaroy, Abbaroy! I want my Abbaroy,” still
piteously cried the sick child. The night without was
raging; the little lamp sent dancing shadows over the
black walls of her room and an unutterable loneliness
took possession of the woman. One by one thoughts
like these arose; “Father dead, mother dead; husband
as good as dead; perhaps really so, and my child like
to die! What if she should die thus crying for her
father! Oh, God spare me this! I’d go mad by her
corpse.” “Abbaroy, I want my Abbaroy,” sobbed the
child in her sleep. The mother heard the waving
palms without. Her vivid imagination turned them
into persons, spirits. They seemed to be her dead ancestors
and they caught up the cry of her child rebukingly
“Abbaroy, I want my Abbaroy.” She swooned
now and slept. In the sleep there came a dream. She
thought she saw her daughter, grown to womanhood,
but pale and sad. She had the hand of her
mother and was drawing her toward the sea. Whenever
the mother drew back the daughter wailed “Abbaroy,
I want my Abbaroy.” Presently their feet touched
the water edge, she saw a ship, floating at anchor, but
with sails spread partly; on its stern was the name,
“<i>England</i>.” The captain stood by the vessel’s side,
observing her. At last he cried: “Well, how long
must we wait for thee?” A wave seemed to dash
against her face and she awakened. The heavy window
blind of stone had swung open, the rain was beating
in on her. She started up and felt for her child,
half fearfully lest a corpse should meet her touch. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
she found her hands clasping a little form with fast
beating heart and burning skin. The light had gone
out, but there alone in that desolate home amid the
ruins of past ages, the woman bowed in agonizing
prayer. The balm of broken hearts was sought and
she for a time was clothed and in her right mind. She
arose, serenely, in the morning the cry of the sea captain
of her dream in her ears, and the firm resolve in
her heart to seek her husband even in far-off England;
with him to try for the things that make for peace.
Then she opened the iron-bound chest that had come
to her from her father and took therefrom a roll of the
‘<i>Kethrubim</i>’ and read. And it so happened that seeking
to refresh her mind as to the story of how the
giant Sampson got honey out of the slain lion’s carcass,
that she might more fully apply the meaning to
her own experience, she came to the story of his birth.
That story fixed her attention for days. It was like a
new revelation to her. And she read and read these
words over and over:</p>

<p>“And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the
Danites, whose name <i>was</i> Manoah.</p>

<p>“And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> appeared unto the
woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou shalt conceive
and bear a son.</p>

<p>“Then the woman came and told her husband, saying,
A man of God came unto me, and his countenance
<i>was</i> like an angel of God, and he said unto me,
Behold thou shalt bear a son.</p>

<p>“Then Manoah entreated the Lord and said, O my
Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come
again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and
the angel of God came again unto the woman.</p>

<p>“And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed
her husband.</p>

<p>“And Manoah arose, and went after his wife and
came to the man.</p>

<p>“And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to
pass. How shall we order the child, and <i>how</i> shall we
do unto him?</p>

<p>“And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Of
all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</p>

<p>“So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and
offered <i>it</i> upon a rock unto the Lord: and <i>the angel</i>
did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</p>

<p>“For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward
heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the
Lord ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah
and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the
ground.”</p>

<p>And as Rizpah read, little by little, the truth and
beauty of the scene and its words dawned upon her.
Thus she meditated: “This is the way God brought
forth His giant deliverer, Samson; God appeared to the
woman first, but she hasted to tell of the promised
blessing to her husband.” When she thought of how
that angel-led wife led her husband, she remembered
her own fanatical bitterness and was condemned.
Then she remembered how Manoah and his wife,
together, asked how they should order their child and
how, as together they bowed before the Spirit, he
ascended in glory over them. “Oh,” she moaned
within herself, “if we had only put aside our differences
and, forgetting all else, just so sought together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the Divine directings!” It was evening as she meditated,
and she said within herself: “If ever I can get
nigh Sir Charleroy’s heart I’ll tell him all this, and before
the altar of a new consecration we’ll give ourselves
and ours to God, just this way.” There came a
wondrous joy to her heart and the palms that seemed
to moan rebukingly without that other night, “Abbaroy,
Abbaroy, I want my Abbaroy,” this night
reminded her some way vaguely of the beating of
mighty wings, approaching nearer and nearer. She
felt no longer rage, as she thought about the often bepraised
Mary of her husband, but on the other hand,
wished she knew more about her, were more like her.
It was the woman in her, yearning for a mother.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Nearly a score of years passed away, each
having wrought its changes, and Rizpah de
Griffin is dwelling quietly with her three
children at Bozrah. She is companionless
though not a widow. Care has left its stern impress on
her every feature; the roses have gone from her cheeks
and the snows that tarry, baffling all springs, are on
her head. But time that has worn has also ripened.
Rizpah has become a self-possessed, stately matron;
her form is erect, her eye as bright as ever. Bozrah
has not changed; the city sits in its sullen, fixed
gloom, seemingly unconscious of the ravages that
time works elsewhere. But there have been changes
and changes among the people since first the woman
of Gerash arrived there. Many former inhabitants have
wandered away; some to be swallowed up by the tides
of peoples of other climes; some have gone to judgment.
But new comers have taken the places of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that had departed and speeded the swift enough forgetting
of the absent ones, Rizpah was in high honor,
for although she lived in seclusion, mixing very little
with any of the people about her, all respected her.
Hers was a well-ordered house; Druses, Turks and
Hebrews joined in affirming this. She ruled her children
firmly and they obeyed her implicitly, for they loved
her loyally. We meet her now amid active preparation
for the observance of the approaching Jewish Sabbath.
With her are two boys, twins, born in London,
as like each other as could be, and Miriamne. The latter
is in the full possession of her roses, and in the enjoyment
of that splendor of personal charm seemingly
belonging to all the maidens of Abrahamic descent
under “the covenant of the stars and the sand.” For
are not Israel’s women not only plenteous and bright
and lofty like the stars, and her men numberless, rugged
and restless as the surf-washed sands on every shore?
Does not this race, in all history, continually attest the
persistence and pre-eminence of all good to those who
walk under the Divine covenants?</p>

<p>Miriamne not only is seen to possess a gracefulness
like unto that of the palm, nature’s pattern of beauty
in the East, but she has such robustness of form as might
be expected in one born of such a Hebrew mother and
such a Saxon father. In her temper, poetic, emotional,
oriental, like her mother; in feature and mind more
like her father; she was a better, more evenly balanced
result than either. It often so happens; the child by
some natural selection or some mercifulness, inheriting
a character, the resultant of the union of two sets of
parental forces, yet finer than either apart. The scientific
man in such cases will say, herein we behold, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
new being, physical and spiritual forces in action, the
latter gaining the advantage; a prophesy without
mystery that at last the fittest only shall survive. The
theologian, on the other hand, will see Providence electing
the best and preparing choice characteristics for
superior works to be done.</p>

<p>At a call of the mother, the children gathered about
her, and the group was charming; a picture full of expression
and contrasts. The matron cast a look of
yearning affection upon her offsprings, and the emotion
possessed her until the hard face-lines faded into a sweet
smile. Just then she would have been a satisfactory
model for an artist painting Madonna. “Thank God,
children, the emblem of rest and of hope in ages to
come is at hand. I have joyed to-day, in full preparation
that this next Sabbath may be piously and earnestly
celebrated with all the religious exactness of our
people.” Then, patting the boys on their heads with
playful tenderness, she continued: “Run away now up
to the synagogue-ruin on the hill. Don’t forget your
duty in play, lads; be true little Israelites! When ye
see the sun go down back of Gilead’s mountains, give
us warning of the Sabbath’s beginning. Now mind,
keep your eyes toward Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>The lads sped away, and Rizpah following them with
her eyes prayed in heart: “God bless them, and though
in this place of desolation, make them little Samuels
in faith and service.” A little after her face glowed
with triumphant joy, for there came back to her ears
the boys’ voices, mingling in sacred song. It was the
psalm of the “Captives’ Return” that they sang. The
declining sun began to throw its last rays through the
open windows of the huge stone home, flooding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
black basalt walls and pavement with golden tints.
Slowly the mother’s eyes wandered from the scene
without to objects within, until they rested on a huge
painting that covered nearly half the opposite wall. One
glance and her whole being seemed transformed. In
an instant her reverential and weary attitude was
changed to one of excited attention. She grew pale,
her body swayed with a waving motion, suggestive of
the panther creeping toward a victim. Then her form
became rigid like one preparing for some great muscular
effort, or endeavoring to suppress some inner tempest.
Her face, made habitually calm by the schoolings
of adversity, became a theater for expression of the
changing emotion within; the mouth-lines putting on
a firmness almost hideous; her eyes glittered like a
serpent’s in the act of charming; contrasting with the
forehead that shone like a silver shield. She was as
one under a spell or in a trance; but for a few moments
only. There came a light footfall; then a quick, half
frightened, piteous cry and Miriamne stood beside her.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, don’t! mother, mother; thou dost terrify
me!” The young woman stopped half way between
the open door and her parent. Now she was passing
through a great transition. She had seen all that was
happening, often before; had often run away from the
spectacle to hide it from herself. Now she was trying
to nerve herself to penetrate the mystery in the hope
of preventing its painfulness. She was at the turning
point, where a girl changes to the woman within the
circle of parental influences.</p>

<p>But so complete was the absorption of the one gazing
upon the spectacle upon the wall, at first the cry
was unheeded. In a sort of sudden, trembling desperation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the young woman quickly bounded between
her mother and the picture. Then, as if realizing the
unfilial imprudence of the act, but still unwilling to
recede from efforts to break the spell that bound her
parent, she fell upon her knees before the seeming devotee
and burst into tears. The mother started up a
little as one awakening from a dream; then said, with
perfect control of voice and manner; “Marah, what
ails thee? Art ill? Are the Bedouin coming?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied the other; “the picture; the
picture!”</p>

<p>“What is it child?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I only know that your strange,
wild gaze upon its hideous group terrifies me! For
years I’ve learned to feel a mingled disgust and
fright in the presence of the woman in that presentment.
When I came in, your face looked like
hers. You did not seem to be my own tender mother,
but an angry virago. Oh, why do you shadow all our
Sabbath eves, by this mysterious, cruel staring and
moaning before this imagery of death? You’ve made
me to dread the approaching Holy Day, promise of all
delight to our people, as the advent of all pain to us.”</p>

<p>“Marah, this is wickedness in thee. Thou shouldst
learn to wrap thy soul about with the joys thou knowest,
and leave all this that thou dost not understand, most
likely terrible to thee chiefly because thou dost not
understand it, to go its way.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried and tried for months to reason thus; but
how little comfort to be saying over and over, ‘it’s
all right,’ ‘it’s nothing,’ to a fear that stops the very
beatings of the heart. Oh, that I could fly from this
land of desolations. Its loneliness and shadows keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
coming and coming around me until I dread, lest they
enter my very being and become part of me. I’ve leaned
hitherto alone on my mother’s greater strength for
rest. If I come to fear her, I’ll lose my reason!”</p>

<p>“Marah,” said the mother, with enforced calmness,
“thou art feverish to-day; thou hast wrought too much.
Now retire and say this pillow Psalm; ‘<i>He that dwelleth
in the secret place of the Most High, abideth under
the shadow of the Almighty.</i>’ Thou’lt be peaceful in
the morning; as are those ever who abide under the
shadow of the King.”</p>

<p>But only the more passionately the daughter clung to
her mother, and again she renewed her plaint: “Ah,
mother, I haven’t strength to take these promises! Oh,
forgive me, I can not help it; I feel as if something
awful were impending; something coming between us!
A curse is on this land. Is it any way over the De
Griffins? Tell me, I beseech you, what is that painted
thing? Sometimes I run out of the room when
alone, as if those men hanging there were still alive, in
death’s agony. I’ve dreamed sometimes that they
came down in bodily form charging you and me with
murdering them; and when I go out at evening, I imagine
that the Ismaelitish woman in the foreground is
flitting about my path, while in every thicket I hear
the flapping wings of her carrion birds. Oh, mother!
let us tear down that sole defilement of our own
little, only home, and give it to the pilgrim Rabbi,
now in Bozrah, that he may burn it with exorcising
rites.”</p>

<p>“Then thou thinkest there’s witchery hereabouts,
Marah,” said the mother, severely.</p>

<p class="caption">RIZPAH DEFENDING THE DEAD BODIES OF HER RELATIONS.</p>
</div>

<p>“I? I do not know what I think, beyond this, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
I’m overcome, terrified, made miserable, and you, under
some spell for a time, cease to be my mother.”</p>

<p>“My daughter profanes her faith by permitting unreined
imaginations to rule her so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me all about this hateful thing! Why it so
moves you. You said long ago you would when I was
able to bear it. I am no longer a child. Mother, you
say you read me like an open book, now look into my
heart and see that it is bursting with fright and worry!
You say you know woman’s nature; if so, you know
that I can suffer when I understand, but shall go mad
in the suspense of constant fear of some threatening ill
unseen.” Thus speaking and clinging to her mother,
with a twining, almost desperate embrace, such as
among women implies unerringly that a supreme moment
and demand has fallen upon the questioner, she
burst forth in tearless sobs. The mother’s face was a
study and told of a succession of weighty thoughts;
parental authority brooked; infringed; new surprised
realization that the daughter was no longer a child, but
a wise, earnest woman. Then there was a degree of
fearfulness springing from deep love. The elder woman
perceived the crisis, and knew full well that in such
times denials to a woman meant a dead heart, or worse.
Then her manner softened, and drawing her child to
her bosom with an embrace passionate in fervor, she
tenderly, soothingly spoke to her:</p>

<p>“My most dearly beloved Marah! dismiss all thy
fears at once and forever. They are needless. Rest,
now and always, as thou never canst elsewhere, in all
the world, upon this heart of mine. Rest thou in thy
present young womanhood, as calmly, as trustingly, as
thou didst in baby-hood. That heart guarded thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
more tenderly than its own life then, through storms
within and without that nearly broke it. In part thou
dost know this; remembering what it has been in
loyalty to God and thyself, canst thou pain it by one
distrusting thought now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, I know, I know; I do not mean to
doubt you, and I remember, with a gratitude beyond
all my poor power of speech, your toiling, patient,
constant, loving care for me and my brothers. I never
can forget that you are a Hebrew indeed, proud to
emulate the noble mothers of our nation in its olden,
golden days; but after all I must think. I think,
sometimes, with anguish, that that awful picture may
some way come between us!”</p>

<p>“Why, Marah, impossible! thou art my other self;
a fairer copy; as I was at thy age.” Then Rizpah spoke
in unusual, confiding tenderness: “We mothers have
our vanities and take a secret pride in wearing our
daughters on our hearts as precious jewels. When
nature gratifies that pride by giving us daughters in
form, features and mind, mirrors or glad reminders of
ourselves, as we were in the days of young beauty,
romancings and hopes, we hug these in our souls in a
way thou canst never realise until thou hast been such a
mother. Change? I change toward thee? Ah, girl,
not being a mother, thou canst not begin to fathom
the ocean-depth, the heaven-height, the eternity-like
unchanging endurance of a woman’s love, once it has
been quickened into the channels of maternal affection.
Thou art a woman to all the world, but not so to me.
I love thee now as I loved thee when thou wert a
babe. To me thou wilt always be a little, lovely,
needy creature—an angel touching the fountains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
my inmost nature. All earthly friendships change;
lover’s love, at first fierce, generally dies as the tides of
years roll over it; but, mother-love, in all loving, is the
exception. Believe this as thou dost believe the tenets
of our faith and thou’ll find thy troubling thoughts
fleeing away like mists of Hermon, before the conquering
banners of the morning.” There followed a prolonged
embrace and a mutual kiss; impassioned, affectionate;
an action expressing volumes to one skilled
in interpreting the signs, all unvoiced and unwritten,
yet, by some constant intuition, known to all womankind
as the language of the finest, sincerest loving.
That moment these two women passed onward, upward
together to a higher, lighter, stronger relationship
than they had enjoyed before. They entered the
temple where daughter and mother begin the feast of
the new revelation; when to the love of parent and
child is added that of real companionship. That is a
sunny, fruity hour, when a girl is received as a woman
by a woman; that woman her mother.</p>

<p>The two sat embracing and happy for a long time;
but the old pain suddenly revived—Miriamne’s eyes
chancing to stray to the picture. She shuddered, then
looked pleadingly into her parent’s eyes. The mother,
quickly interpreting the look, tenderly replied: “Sometime.”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no; tell me, mother, all, now! Who,
and what are those hanging forms: the horror-frighted,
bludgeon-armed woman; the birds of black, hovering
over the crosses? Oh! my mother, you trust me; now
tell me all or tear that down! You know it’s not lawful
for us Jews to have any image of things in Hades.”</p>

<p>The last words moved the mother more than all else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
that Miriamne had hitherto spoken. Heresy, she
abominated; and the chief aim of her life had been to
make her children true Israelites by precept and example.
To her thinking, Israel alone was right; all
others were heathen, to whom was reserved perdition.
To an apostate, in her belief, there came a final judgment
of misery, beggaring all attempt at description.
A little while she hesitated, and then came to quick
resolve to tell her daughter all. She arose, walked
rapidly back and forth over the stone floor of the
abode, and, then stopping before the daughter, said:
“Thy wish shall be granted. In love of thee, for lo,
these many years I’ve hidden from thee one miserable
and dark chapter of our family history. I have drank
the bitter waters alone. But too much I love thee to
bear the piteous appeal of thy lips, or the look of
doubt that sometimes flits in thy questioning eyes.
Canst thou bear knowledge that is full of bitterness?”</p>

<p>“Yea, mother,” said Miriamne, “there is no bitterness
in reality like that our imaginations conjure up, when
fed by mysteries that hang on pictures of such hideous
mien——”</p>

<p>“Thou dost force me to the explanation, but, daughter
blame me not, if, like Saul of old, who fainted at
the sight he compelled Endor’s witch to reveal, thou
art given now some knowledge that kills thy sunshine.”</p>

<p>“I’m the daughter of Rizpah and Sir Charleroy. Did
they either of them ever fear?”</p>

<p>“Ah! but I have been the very mother of sorrows,
ever since thy birth, child. God knows it; and it
were best to leave it all to Him alone.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, I’d gladly share your sorrows. Sorrow
shared is ever lightened by the sharing. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
bear the corpse between us, and in this lonely life we
shall be made more than ever companions, through a
common grief.”</p>

<p>“So be it then. Thou shalt know all.”</p>

<p>And Rizpah, going to a seldom-used iron-bound
chest, drew therefrom a parchment roll; handing the
same to her daughter, she said: “Read. It’s part of
Father Harrimai’s ‘<i>Kethubim</i>.’” The place opened to
the story of the famine in David’s time, which endured
three years, because of wrongs done to the Gibeonites
by the children of Israel. As Miriamne read onward,
Rizpah from time to time gave explanations:</p>

<p>“Dost perceive, daughter, that Jehovah, though
not revengeful, is a God of recompenses?”</p>

<p>“He was the friend of the Gibeonites though they
were not of his chosen people; because they had no
other friend, I think,” said Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Yes, and He held all Israel responsible for what
they were willing to let their blood-thirsty Saul perform.
As he had been, so had been the people; they
were guilty, and God needed to punish them. How
just! Oh! God is sure to press men to a conclusion.
Read what David said to the stranger Gibeonites;”
Miriamne continued:</p>

<p>“And he said, what ye shall say, <i>that</i> will I do for
you.</p>

<p>“And they answered the king, the man that consumed
us, and that devised against us;</p>

<p>“Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and
we will hang them up unto the Lord in Gibeah.</p>

<p>“And the king said, I will give them.</p>

<p>“But the king spared Mephiboseth, the son of Jonathan
the son of Saul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the king took the two sons of Rizpah, the
daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni
and Mephiboseth; and the five sons of Michal the
daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel.</p>

<p>“And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites,
and they hanged them in the hill before the
Lord: and they fell all seven together, and were put to
death in the beginning of barley harvest.”</p>

<p>Miriamne paused; then addressed her parent:</p>

<p>“Mother, I’d not be an heretic, and yet I can not see
the justice of hanging the sons for the father’s sins?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they were parties to the murder; perhaps
publicly, or in heart, defended it. At any rate, from
the beginning it has been so. Thou and thy brothers
are living here fatherless on account of him that begat
you——”</p>

<p>“Shall I stop reading this bloody story?” quoth
Miriamne.</p>

<p>“It pains thee. Thou must go on now, though thou
shouldst fall fainting, as Saul at Endor. Read.”</p>

<p>The daughter complied, and with quickly revived interest,
for she came to the name “Rizpah” the second
time, but before she had not noticed it in reading.</p>

<p>“And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth
and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning
of harvest until water dropped upon them out
of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to
rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by
night.</p>

<p>“And it was told David what Rizpah, the daughter
of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</p>

<p>“And David went and took the bones of Saul
and the bones of Jonathan, his son, from the men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen them from the street
of Beth-shan.</p>

<p>“And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul
and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered
the bones of them that were hanged.</p>

<p>“And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son
buried they in the country of Benjamin, in Zelah, in
the sepulcher of Kish, his father: and they performed
all that the king commanded. And after that God
was entreated for the land.”</p>

<p>When the last clause was finished, Miriamne cast a
glance at the huge painting on the wall.</p>

<p>“I understand in part; that is Rizpah and her crucified
children?”</p>

<p>“It is well, daughter. Behold her; this is motherhood
of strongest type! Humanity is no where perfect,
but of all the erring ones of life, I most believe in
those, who, among many perversions of judgment and
blemishes of character, have some one or more of lofty
virtues. Methinks a soul may be drenched by many
sins, and yet, if within its very core it carry sincerely
and sacred as its life some noble, dominating passion,
like the holy love of parent for a child, that soul will
ever have thereby a gate open to the Holy Spirit, a
handle for the grasp of saving angels, and, while life
lasts, an ever-flying signal lifted toward heaven. Such
prayer unspoken is a beseeching, not vainly for the interceding
love of Him that weighs the spirits.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, you’re not such a tigress? Not like
that woman?”</p>

<p>“How proud I’d be to be indeed all she was. The
exact interpretation of ‘Rizpah’ is a ‘living coal,’ but
her name interpreted by her life is better called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
‘flaming beacon.’ We mutually lament the dispersion
of our people! Dost thou remember how last Sabbath
thou wepst while thou didst read to me the words
of the blessed Isaiah foretelling the long-delayed but
Divinely-promised regathering of all our tribes?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that the hills of Judea would glow with the
beacons of that day!”</p>

<p>“Daughter, God’s beacons are chiefly noble spirits,
such as Moses of the Exode, Samson, the giant, David,
Nehemiah and Cyrus. The world has not yet interpreted
Rizpah, the ‘burning coal,’ the beacon fire.
Once I was frail, timorous, wavering, but devotion to
that character has transformed me. When the world’s
mothers look to her pattern, there will be a new order
of motherhood; then look for heroic men and an heroic
age!”</p>

<p>“But was not Rizpah a Hivite, a descendant of
Ham, and so of those forever under God’s curse?”</p>

<p>“My child, ancestry is not always the test of worth.
The consequences of sin may pass down from sire to
son, but never so as to bar the way to hope, nor dam
up the stream of ever-pitying mercy of heaven. Rizpah
had some true Jewish blood within her heart, and
in the long run God’s providence doth work to make
the better part, of admixed good and ill, dominate. Besides
all this, the lovely Ruth, thou dost emulate so well,
was foreign to our people. So, too, was Rahab; and our
Rabbis tell us she was in the royal line of David, from
which at last the Messiah shall arise. Those women,
with Rizpah, were beacons to the world! While mankind
revere true love, constancy, loyalty and faith,
those names will be remembered.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, Rizpah was the concubine of Saul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and as I think of how you oft denounce the harems of
our neighboring Bedawin, my very soul blushes at hearing
you admire this woman so.”</p>

<p>“Ah, daughter, methinks she was more sinned against
than sinning. Recall the unequal struggle: Rizpah, a
foreigner, of a nation subdued by kingly Saul; he a
man, strong of mind, a king, hedged with a sort of
divinity that in the minds of the simple ever hedges
kings about; making their words and deeds seem
always right and just. If women made the laws and
customs there never would have been known on earth
unclean polygamy, but ever instead thereof the union
only, in holy wedlock, of two lives, mutually consecrated,
serviceful and constant. Under wrong teaching
and tyranny, a woman may do that which purer
societies condemn, and yet retain a conscience white
and clean before God.</p>

<p>“Within that book of Samuel, which I hold, it is recorded
that Ishbosheth, a son of Saul, who for a time
reigned in a rebellious confederacy, a horseman’s day’s
journey from here, at Mahanaim, charged Rizpah once
with an act of impurity.</p>

<p>“The record makes no mention of Rizpah’s reply.
Like thousands of women before and since her time,
she was defenseless against slander. Men, the stronger,
may malign without evidence, and often it doth outweigh,
to ears ripe to feast upon the carrion of a scandal,
the indignant denial of outraged purity, accompanied
even with evidences which make the thought of crime
upon the part of the one belied, seemingly an impossibility.
But leave all that; I appeal in behalf of my revered
Rizpah to her wondrous loyalty as a mother. Tell
me not that this sublimely heroic woman, who patiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
watched the corpses of her sons and other kin from
April, through all the lonely nights and through all
those burning days, until October rains wept them to
their burial, ever did an act that could let loose upon
them living or dead the hounds of scandal! They may
have suffered death as malefactors, in God’s sight, but
still her mother-love clung to them. She who kept
those long vigils, lest beast or bird of prey should harm
or mar or pollute the bodies precious to her if to no
one else, I am assured, beyond all cavil, never did
aught that could have stung their brows or embittered
their hearts! Such motherly devotion as hers doth
fully purify a woman. He who planned society, with
its sacred foundations resting so largely on the integrity
of its child-bearers, has planted in the bosom of woman
this all-possessing love of her offspring, as her safeguard.
It’s her wall of fire by day and by night, and
verily more restraining to her than any law of man,
command of God, or fear of hell!”</p>

<p>“And are loving mothers never unchaste?”</p>

<p>“The Jews hated swine and the monster deities of
Chaldeans, because both destroyed their young, and
our holy Talmudists declare that Mary of the Christians,
not being as pure as the Nazarene’s followers
affirm, is doomed to bide even in lowest Hades with
the bar of hell’s gate through her ear. No, I, as a
Jewish woman, believe that one of my sex being a
mother and impure is neither loving, nor a woman!”</p>

<p>“How I revere the noble sentiments of Rizpah of
Bozrah!”</p>

<p>“For all I am, after God, praise that ancient, fervent
beacon, Rizpah of Gibeah!”</p>

<p>“I am in part reconciled to her, but yet I wish, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
frightened agony often, that you would renounce this
historic Rizpah; lioness-like in her devotion to her offspring,
but full of murderous fury toward any that
crossed her love. Our holy book must have sweeter,
nobler ideals for our inspiration.”</p>

<p>“I judge this Hebrew heroine mother by her influence
upon me, and that has been for good. The
hypocrite or romancer may call the passer-by to prayer
and have no more soul in it than the Moslem trumpet.
Only those who have some God-like saintliness of
character, can win effectually, unceasingly. There is
mighty power in the unspoken sermons of such a life.
<i>I cherish</i> Rizpah, whose touch of moral power, coming
where and when I was weak to callowness, girded me
with purpose for wavering and thews of steel for rosy
softness. I was once like thee, a fragile flower, but the
example of that patient woman’s heroism, ever before
me, has fitted me to meet my awful trials and worthily
inhabit this giant-built house. Thou dost remember,
Miriamne, at last Passover time they wish, as thou
didst read to me of Jacob, that even now a ladder with
communicating angels might be set up from earth to
heaven?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that would be a feast; angels in burning
bushes, or by fountains as in Hagar’s time! I often
worship in the thicket and pray for heaven’s messengers
from Paradise to fan the flames of our devotion,
as Gabriel did the orisons of Daniel. But I’d be afraid
to meet an angel like your Rizpah.”</p>

<p>“Not so with me, Marah. Indeed, I often think of
Rizpah and Jacob together. Thou rememberest how,
not far away, at Mahanaim, Jacob of old met a host of
angels? They came to cheer him in an hour of sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
depression, the saddest kind indeed; for in that hour
he remembered amid his repentings that he was soon
to face the brother whom long years before he had
wronged. Well, when Rizpah, by the death of Saul,
was released from that domineering madman-king,
she made her home at Mahanaim, the place near which
Jacob counseled with the angels. Methinks she there
also communed with the spirits that do excel in strength.
She may have been weak before, but in that angel
school she outgrew her master. Ay, my child, it is
marvelous how a woman rises under the impulses of a
noble love, holy companionship and plenty of sorrow.
Many a male brute has flattered himself he was crushing
into fawning servitude by his imperious, selfish will,
his weaker child-burdened mate, only some day to find
the victim asserting her individuality with power unearthly.
The partridge skulks, terrified amid lowly
grasses from the hunter, little by little gathering courage
for her pinions, then she suddenly departs to
return no more, meanwhile luring the hunter from her
treasures.”</p>

<p>“That is, an abused wife should run away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps not; but she may rise above her
tyrant.”</p>

<p>“I can’t but remember the woman’s rough strength.”</p>

<p>“To me the all-controlling love of Rizpah for her
children condones her former errings, her Philistine
ancestry, her craggedness. I believe she soars with the
angels now, and to Israel she must be a pattern until
some more saintly and finer woman arises to take the
leadership of woman.”</p>

<p>“Will such an one appear, mother?”</p>

<p>“God’s dial is a circle, with a sweep like eternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
He knows no hurry; yet, though never weary, is never
belated. We are not waiting for him, but He is for us.
When man is ready to take up his pilgrim march to the
highlands of a living, all light, all beautiful, there’ll be
beacons and beacons from the valleys to the hills.”</p>

<p>Just then the lamp by which they had been sitting,
for some time having only flickered, was suddenly
quenched, and there was a sound of the fluttering of
wings in the room. Miriamne screamed and clung to
her mother, her thoughts on the vultures of the picture.</p>

<p>“’Twas only a bat, daughter!”</p>

<p>“Oh, this ghostly place!” the young woman cried.</p>

<p>“Ghosts and bats are very harmless; would men
were like them!” bitterly spoke Rizpah.</p>

<p>“A bat putting out our light; it’s like an omen!”</p>

<p>“Yes, wrongs do put out the light of human joy, but
only for a little while; look out to the firmament, my
clinging other self, as I do, for comfort by times. See,
the stars are immovable; all bright and in seemingly
everlasting calm. Never forget in any long trial, or
sudden terror, that when our human-made lights expire
we are to turn our eyes toward heaven. In truth, God
Himself often quenches our lights to make us look up
to His.” The mother, approaching the stone casement,
and looking out on the sky, continued: “The
heavens are full of beacons and lamps. They shall
light us to bed as His truth lights those who will to
serene, long rest. Good night, my child.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Another Passover season was at hand, and
the few Israelites in and about Bozrah, not
being permitted to celebrate the feast, at
Jerusalem were gathering for a “Little
Passover” at the Giant City. There was sadness, murmurings
and fears in the hearts of the people. Sadness
in remembering the decadence of Israel; fears, for
there were Mamelukes hovering threateningly in large
numbers near the city; murmurings, because fault-findings,
the last stage to indifference, flourish when
religion is decaying. Faith and doubt waged their
eternal battle; and at Bozrah, doubt appealing to present
facts, had the easier part against faith, appealing
to past providences or unseen hopes. There was
clamor for a change, but the leaders of the people were
purblind to any new light. They crushed their own
secret doubts and continued to enforce what they believed,
because they had believed it. They felt a sense
of responsibility, and that made them very conservative.
Before the sun had reached high-noon Bozrah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
was all astir. There were but two principal streets
in the city; these ran by the four great points of the
compass and crossed at its center. Two companies of
Jews of very different make-up, each moving along one
of those streets, met, and, in passing, quite accidentally,
the two processions formed a cross. One of the companies
was made up of priests and serious old men, the
true elders of the people. They tried to appear very
wise and very pious, and succeeded. They tried as well
to cheer and comfort all, and did not succeed very well.
The other company was made up of young Israelitish
men. They were going eastward; the old men walked
northward, away from the sun, now a little more than
southeast. By the side of the elders glided a row of
shadows of their own making. But they were as
unconscious of these as of the shadows their musty
traditions flung over the people.</p>

<p>The youths felt like singing, so they sang. The
sadness that was so general was not very deep with
them. They would have liked to have sung a sort
of convivial song; but, that being forbidden, they compromised
with their consciences and the situation
by singing the one hundred and twenty-second Psalm,
with the vigor of a madrigal. They had a surplusage
of vitality, and they let it flow out in the pious
canticle. Certainly they conserved outward propriety;
as to their inward feelings, they themselves hardly
knew what they were; hence, it would be unjust,
for one without, to pass judgment. The Psalm was
appointed to be sung at this feast. They say the returning
captives, coming from Babylon, centuries before,
sang this song as they ascended to a sight of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, some of the elders had come to think it piety
to morbidly nurse their sorrows. They were never
happy except when they were miserable. One of these
paused and addressed the young singers:</p>

<p>“Children, cease. Your time is too much like a
dancer’s.”</p>

<p>Then all eyes turned toward the leader of the
youths, a man with a Saul-like neck, large mouth, wet,
thick lips, and burning eyes; all bespeaking a person
who is never religious beyond the drawings of religious
excitement, for excitement’s sake, and never self-restraining,
except as checked by fear of a very material
hell. Such an one, if he have any regularity in
his piety, will have it because somebody opposes, or
because, having swallowed, with one lazy gulp, a heavy
creed, he thereafter goes about condoning by habit his
petty vices, in trying to force others to be better than
he himself ever expects to be. Such are never spiritual,
and seldom martyrs; but they make good persecutors,
and so do a work that compels others, by suffering, to
be spiritual, and, may be, good martyrs. This leader
made sharp retort, thrusting out his chin to enforce it:</p>

<p>“The Psalm is all right, and, if the old men sang
more, they would have less time for moaning. Singing
and moaning are much alike, only the former
cheers men, the latter, devils!”</p>

<p>“Son,” replied the patriarch, “revile not the fathers.
We do not condemn thy joy as sin; but yet it now
seems inopportune. We are entering captivity, not
liberation. Our holy and our beautiful temple is in
ruins; our people like hunted quail.”</p>

<p>“But, this is feast time,” said the youth.</p>

<p>“What a feast! I remember it as it was when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
nation gathered at Jerusalem, to the number of
nigh 3,000,000, and offered 250,000 lambs. Ah,
now, a handful, in this grim old city surrounded by
aliens!”</p>

<p>The elder, so speaking, bowed his head, threw his
mantle over his eyes and wept; meanwhile his fellow-elders
gathered about him, very reverently, and waved
their hands rebuking toward the youths. Just then
there drew near a beautiful Jewess, led by an aged
man, the latter garbed partly as an Israelite, and partly
as one of the Druses. He had a saintly mien, and fixed
the attention of the elders; but, the young men, with
one accord, youth-like, at once erected, in silent worship,
an unseen altar of devotion to the new goddess.
The grouping was striking and suggestive. The
stranger was silent, and seemed to be intent on passing
by so; but the elders felt their responsibility. It is
the fate of the religious leader to be expected to
explain every thing. He must talk to every body, and
about every matter. He cannot, when he will, keep
quiet and so get the credit for fullness of wisdom, as do
some. He must express an opinion, for silence is
deemed a greater sin in such than insincerity or words
out of ignorance. The foremost of the elders felt
called to act, and so confronting the two new comers,
sternly addressed the maiden:</p>

<p>“I perceive that thou art of my people; wherefore
comest thou here, and in this companionship? Knowest
thou not that women are forbidden to be at the
first of the feast?”</p>

<p>The young men were not in accord with the elder;
they stood apart, and some whispered to others:</p>

<p>“It is Miriamne de Griffin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden shrank back a little; but the saintly man
with her, advancing a step, replied:</p>

<p>“I am the maiden’s guardian to-day, fathers, and
responsible for her act. Say on!”</p>

<p>The elder, though knowing full well who the speaker
was, and also fully understanding the import of his
challenge, pretended to have neither heard nor seen
him. He looked past the speaker, who was championing
the maiden, and continued:</p>

<p>“Do thy people at home know of these indiscreet
acts?”</p>

<p>“Hold, Rabbi! no insinuations.” The saintly man’s
voice was commanding, and compelled silence. He
continued: “We go our way, ye yours. Ye can not
help yourselves out of your miseries; then presume
not to direct us.” He checked his rising anger, remembering
that he was a religious teacher, and
launched out in a wayside sermon. “Ye children of
Abraham, hear me, though I came not to counsel. Ye
have stopped my progress, now hear God’s truth!
There are dangers without, but greater ones within;
though your eyes, being veiled, ye perceive not these
things. I noticed as I was coming this way that the
tombs and grave-stones every where have been whitened
recently. They tell me this was done so as to enable
your people plainly to see them and so avoid them.
Yet fleeing defilement of the dead, ye live in a grave,
all of you. All your prefiguring feasts have ripened
into a glowing present that treads out into a full
day!”</p>

<p>The old men seemed puzzled and angry; the young
men puzzled but glad. They welcomed any sermon if
it came with novelty. They reasoned within themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that the old teachings were dead, and that a new
creed could be no worse. If it were novel, it would
have at least a temporary freshness.</p>

<p>The speaker proceeded, for the congregation before
him, being divided in sentiment, invited him, so far, to
proceed.</p>

<p>“Oh, nation, called to be the light of the world,
ye bear but phantom torches. Ye move sorrowfully,
surrounded by walls of cloud, but just beyond there
lies a glorious firmament, aglow with suns of hope and
a thousand golden-arched doors made of realized prophecies
and promises ripened. Can ye make these
ruined habitations of mighty men, now sleeping in the
cliffs and valleys about us, again teem with their former
life? No, no! yet less readily can ye make your dead,
finished, vanishing types take new life. Ye are puzzled
and partially angry, but hold in check the hot
blood. I’ll soon depart; yet before I go, I’ll tell ye,
all, this for your deepest thinking: Ye can never celebrate
again the Passover! God shut ye from your
Temple long ago to teach you this; these traveling
ceremonials of yours are but mockeries. The last real
passover was celebrated when your fathers slew the
Nazarene——”</p>

<p>“Let us stone him!” vehemently cried the brawny
leader of the youths, and the elders turned their backs,
as if to give approval to the violence, but not incur liability
by witnessing.</p>

<p>The brawny youth seized a boulder as if to begin;
the saintly man did not move, and another youth
seized the arm of the youth of brawn.</p>

<p>“Young men, I’ll show you an entrancing picture,”
was the saintly man’s calm words. They were instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
intent. “Look, you and your old men
make the sign of the cross by your ranks.
Look again, by the cross stands this damsel, simple,
pure and loving; an ideal woman. Her name, Miriamne,
or Mary. Do not delude yourselves into the
belief that it will be safe or possible for you to silence
truth by murdering me. I’d despise your attempt if I
did not pity your thoughtless rage. Do not forget the
picture of this hour. The Passover will be fully celebrated
when the power of the cross and the presence
of purity is universally felt in earth. Only your men attend
this your sacrifice. It is well; and when men
truly bear the burden of sacrifice, women will be at
their feast. Now, then, take heed. Farewell, ancients!”</p>

<p>So saying the saintly man of strange garb suddenly
turned away, drawing the Jewess with him. The elders
were confounded; they could not find words at the
moment for reply; they were stung by the pleased and
approving glances that the young men gave the departing
couple. The elders would have been pleased
to have taken the Jewish maiden from her escort with
violence, but the latter was a brawny man. The elders
knew the youths would not aid; to attempt it themselves
would be likely to be a failure, certainly undignified.
They deemed it wise, in any event, to conserve
their dignity, and being unable to do any thing
more terrific, they hissed an orthodox malediction after
the departing man and woman. That made the elders
feel a little better. The two companies at the crossing
of the streets fell to musing and conversing, but in
different groups. The old men talked as old men, deploring
the present and be-praising the past; the youths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
deplored the present and be-praised the future; some
of them trying to interpret the words of the saintly man.
They all wanted to be very orthodox Jews, and yet
they all felt that the stranger’s words were full of
sweetness and good cheer. Some of the youths, like
others of their age, had unconsciously sided with the
strangers on account of the woman’s influence. They
admired her, and the side she was on was charmingly
invincible.</p>

<p>“<i>The Arabs are coming!</i>”</p>

<p>It was a cry starting up from all directions, and
passed from lip to lip like the tidings of fire at night.
The city was soon in confusion and panic; then mixed
crowds surged toward the crossing of the streets like
terrified sheep. They needed leaders or shepherds.
But the elders so lavish in advice usually, were dumb
with fright now. Yet every body looked toward them
for direction. Suddenly, the saintly man and the
Jewess reappeared; as suddenly transformed to a self-reliant
leader, she cried out: “Youths of Israel, to the
defense; the enemy come in by the wall toward the Sun
Temple’s ruins!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s the ‘Angel of Death,’” cried the thick-necked
leader of the youths.</p>

<p>“The All-Father of the covenant forefend!” groaned
some of the elders.</p>

<p>“Fathers,” cried the Jewess, “pray as you can, but
we younger ones must fight as well as pray. Pray the
men to go to a charge!”</p>

<p>“A Deborah!” shouted the thick-necked youth.
“Now lead and we’ll follow!”</p>

<p>“Shame!” cried the saintly man. “Lead yourselves!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no need of argument; the thick-necked
youth waved his hand to the other young men and
they all dashed away toward the advance of the
enemy; all of the city having a mind to fight, becoming
instant volunteers. But the elders, with a piety enforced
by prudence concluded to stay at the crossing
and pray. Perhaps in their hearts they reasoned that
if the enemy were repulsed they might claim the
glory of having sustained the fighters, as Aarons and
Hurs; if the youths and their followers were overcome,
then they, the elders, might claim prescience and say
at the end: “We knew it were vain to resist.”</p>

<p>Soon there were heard the shouts and clangor of
conflict. The fight was on. Miriamne breathlessly
carried the news to her mother.</p>

<p>The matron laid her hand on her bosom, not to still
a fluttering heart, but affectionately to toy with the
handle of her faithful dagger.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, when will these troublous times end?
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Daughter, fight! if need be.”</p>

<p>“But we are only women!”</p>

<p>“But this is woman’s time; remember Sisera!”
Rizpah began dressing for departure.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, wait! Let us send the boys for news
into the city. Perhaps the worst has not come, when
the mothers must take arms.”</p>

<p>Rizpah silently assented. The boys were sent, and
in half an hour returned with hot and beaming faces.
“The Mamelukes are all slung out of the city! Lots
of them killed,” both exclaimed, between their pantings.</p>

<p>“How brothers: is it all over?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, all over! They’re gone! Oh, you ought to
have seen how our young men and the Druses raced
them,” interposed one.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for the Druses we’d all been murdered!”
cried the other. Then the brothers caught up
the narrative in turn.</p>

<p>“And, Miriamne, some of the young soldier-like
men, after the fight, went about shouting ‘<i>cheers for the
flag of Maccabees and the maid of Bozrah!</i>’ They
say the ‘maid of Bozrah’ means you. What do they
intend?”</p>

<p>Miriamne seemed not to hear the question. She was
engrossed with her own thoughts and thus was meditating:
“It’s just as the Old Clock Man said! The Druses
by their needed aid prove it; the Jews need a Saviour!”</p>

<p>“Boys,” presently questioned Rizpah, “Were many
of the heretics killed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ever so many! Yes, and we want cloths for
the wounded,” said the questioned lads.</p>

<p>“Now, may the alien dead rot!”</p>

<p>“But we must bring cloths.”</p>

<p>“Who says it?”</p>

<p>“The ‘Old Clock Man’ told every body to help the
hurt.”</p>

<p>“And who, pray, is this ‘Old Clock Man?’”</p>

<p>Rizpah was quickly answered by Miriamne.</p>

<p>“I know him, mother. He’s the leader of the
Christians here, and a wondrously good old man who
heals the sick, feeds the poor, teaches the ignorant and
gives the true time of day to every body by the bell of
his religious house!”</p>

<p>The mother fixed her eyes penetratingly upon Miriamne
for a moment, then frigidly questioned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“And since thou hast disobeyed me in making the
acquaintance of a stranger, thou wilt now explain why
thou hast never mentioned to me this ‘Old Clock
Man’ of whom thou dost seem to know so much!
Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s the ‘Old Clock Man’ who mends poor
people’s clocks, plays with the children and is doing
every body kindness!”</p>

<p>“Some Christian witchery!”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, he’s an angel if ever there was one on
earth!”</p>

<p>“Is he a Jew?” almost hissed Rizpah.</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten to ask about that; but I’m certain
he is, if only Jews are good, for he is a saint
of God.”</p>

<p>Rizpah’s face wore a sneer as she again spoke:
“How canst thou tell, Inexperience?”</p>

<p>“By acts. He goes about seeking poor people to
clothe and feed, and he is their physician as well, and
will take no pay.”</p>

<p>“Some Christian perverter, trying to seduce the
unthinking by pretended service. Beware of such,
Miriamne!”</p>

<p>“But healing the sick and setting people’s clocks
right can’t do harm! I’m certain of that?”</p>

<p>“How sly; he would set all Jewry to Christian time
and faith at the same instant!”</p>

<p>“I love his way, mother; it is so good; more I do
not know.”</p>

<p>“The old knave!”</p>

<p>“Oh! mother, he is old, but no knave. Ought we
not to be reverent to the hoary head in the way of righteousness?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yet an old man may poison women and children.
I told thee the story of Agag once, daughter.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I mean now to tell thee if this man be not a Jew,
let him be like Agag, hewn to pieces. Flee him as a
leper.”</p>

<p>“He don’t talk so. He says all mankind are brothers.
Only to-day, he cried, to the men in the beginning
of the fight, ‘save your families as best you may,’
kill the wounded Moslem with kindness!” The rapid
converse of the two women was interrupted by the impatient
cry of the boys for wraps and lint. As they
started away, Miriamne darted after them, saying: “I’ll
go and help those caring for the wounded.”</p>

<p>“Wayward,” called after her the mother, “remember
my commands. Keep away from the old Perverter,
and minister to suffering Israelites, only. God can
spare the rest! Let them die.”</p>

<p>In the midst of the suffering ones, Miriamne soon
found herself, and as might be expected; there, too,
was the “Old Clock Man.” As they met he said,
laconically, “It is fitting that woman’s tender hands
minister thus.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” was her reply.</p>

<p>Presently Miriamne questions, with an unaffected
diffidence, her companion.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me your name?”</p>

<p>“Call me father, that’s enough.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but I can not, you are not my father.”</p>

<p>“I may be.”</p>

<p>“What jest is this! I’ve a father living?”</p>

<p>“I am father to multitudes, but after the flesh, childless.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, thy children are dead, then?”</p>

<p>“Nay, some dead and some living; but, living or
dead, they are my children.”</p>

<p>“This is a wilderment to me. Where is your wife?”</p>

<p>“Everywhere. In early youth, with vows unutterable,
I wed my church. She is Humanity’s mother, and
I the father of all of her children, who will let me serve
them.”</p>

<p>“And is this the Christian faith?”</p>

<p>“It is mine, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I like it. I’m sure it must be safe; being so good,
and so you may be my father that way. Are there
many fathers like you?”</p>

<p>“Many, and many needed, else sin will make all orphans.”</p>

<p>“And you have no wife, no home?”</p>

<p>“A home most beautiful, which, at sunset, I’ll enter
through a door, once shut, not possible to be opened
by my hands, though its fastenings be but grass and
daisies.”</p>

<p>“You mean death?” As she said it, tears welled
in Miriamne’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Weep not, my child, death is beautiful, at least
to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good man—father. I do not yet know how to
think about you or these things that you say. What
made you so different from the people I know?”</p>

<p>“A woman, a lovely woman.”</p>

<p>“Your mother?”</p>

<p>“Not as you think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then pardon my curiosity. You had some
love?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why did you not wed her? Did she die?”</p>

<p>“A woman’s question? I’ll tell thee all some other
time. I hear approaching voices.”</p>

<p>“Tell me just a little more now; do?”</p>

<p>“Are the wounded all attended properly? Mercy
first, stories and sermons after.”</p>

<p>“Ah, here come my brothers. I’ll inquire;” and
away ran Miriamne to a group of youths, singing a
roundelay, of which she caught but a few lines;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>Miriamne comprehended the situation in a moment,
and all radiant with smiles, bounded to the side of her
aged friend, crying: “Father, oh, you’ve a bonny family
coming; over fifty youths and maidens; some Jews,
some Gentiles. They’ve been comforting the wounded
and now have spontaneously formed some sort of
friendly guild.”</p>

<p>“That’s praiseworthy so far,” the saintly man replied.</p>

<p>“And don’t blush; when I asked the leader what
were their purposes and name, a dozen cried out at
once; ‘We’re Father Adolphus’s angels of mercy!’”</p>

<p>“They could easily have found a better title, but
youth in its frank celerity interprets human need. We
all must have a pattern or hero. That’s the reason there
are pagans; not finding the true God, some invent one.
Anyway, God blesses the merciful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, these angels are splendid; so earnest; so happy;
so every thing good! They all wear balsam-twig
crowns, and are singing improvised ditties about charity
and humanity, and such like.”</p>

<p>“Praised be God if they mean them, daughter.”</p>

<p>“Mean them? Why they’ll make the ancients groan
if they go to the crossways with their enthusiastic singing.
‘Black-frowns!’ if they disturb the Passover solemnities,
won’t there be trouble?</p>

<p>“And Bozrah will never understand the meaning of
the ceremonial, the phantom of which meaning some
to-day are pursuing, until it beholds sweet charity
sincerely applied, rising with healing and life in its
wings to pass over savingly where humanity has pains
and death.”</p>

<p>The old priest looked away toward Jerusalem, as he
spoke—his voice meanwhile becoming very tender,
almost tremulous. Had one been able to enter his
heart, there would have been seen a memory picture of
Calvary. Miriamne was awed for a few moments; the
old man was lost in thought; presently she recalled his
attention: “Father, the band is just at hand. Shall I
introduce you?”</p>

<p>“It is needless; I formed that Band of Charity,
though I gave them not the name; most all except
the recruits of to-day know me.”</p>

<p>The singers went by, saluting the priest as they
passed; obeying his signal to them not to tarry.</p>

<p>Miriamne turned to her comrade with quickened confidence,
and with her usual impetuosity exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I want to be what you like. Make me a Balsamite!”</p>

<p>“Thou hast a mother who might object.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, no; not if she knew all, as do I.”</p>

<p>“Some have called my work witchcraft.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care, since I know better. Make me a
Balsamite, now, please?”</p>

<p>“So be it, child. Put thy hand on thy heart and
repeat: ‘<i>I promise my Merciful Father always to show
heartfelt kindness to all His creatures, especially those in
misery, because of His everlasting goodness toward myself.</i>’”</p>

<p>“I promise that gladly. Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes; thy badge, a sprig of the evergreen balm-shrub,
shall teach thee the rest.”</p>

<p>“Teach me the rest?”</p>

<p>“Puzzled again, child? Well, I’ll teach thee, and
the shrub shall recall my lessons. As thou dost
learn to love nature, as thou wilt when getting back
to a more child-like faith, nature will talk to thee
all the time. See, this is unfading; so is mercy.
When torrid suns make the shrub suffer, it sweats or
weeps these healing gums. Trials make all good souls
fruitful. Then see, this little shrub gives to the world
all it receives, transforming its earthy nourishments,
sunshines and showers, into a medicament for sufferers.
It is a type of the All-Giver. It has but three flowers,
and I read in these the signature of a Triune God.
This thou wilt, perhaps, read some time for thyself,
when thou hast learned the mystery of the Unspeakable
Gift.”</p>

<p>“My father, your wisdom is very beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Would, my child, that my words ever be to thee
as the nuts of this little evergreen emblem, though
rough-coated, still filled with liquid of honey sweetness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden yearned to embrace the priest. Had
she done so, her feelings would have been like those
of a daughter toward a father, or a devotee toward
God. She yearned to express love for father. The
fountain of that affection, hitherto unevoked, was full.
But she restrained herself, and said, as she clasped the
old man’s arm: “May I be crowned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, daughter; having served the bleeding as thou
didst to-day, thou mayst.” The priest twined together
some of the balsam bows and placed them upon her
brow. “I saw once, at Damascus, a painted presentment
of the mother of our Lord, on wood, from which,
continuously, there exuded a precious nard, of all
healing virtue. So they said, at least; and more than
this, I was assured it had power to heal even the
wounds of infidels.”</p>

<p>“Is this really so?”</p>

<p>“I believe a Christian kindness to an unbeliever a
medicine to the soul of the blesser and blest. That’s
why I’m merciful to Moslem.”</p>

<p>“But you court dangers, do you not? I remember
your telling me once, that fanatics, or men with a false
religion, falsely practiced, were like mad dogs—one
could never tell when they might bite the kindest
master.”</p>

<p>“True, some forgetting the essence of all religion
worth the name, Charity, to propagate their theories,
easily befool their consciences and murder gratitude.
But ingratitude is a Christian and Jewish, as well as a
heathen fault. In this all are alike. Still, though a
man spoil all the good I try to do him, there’s one
thing he can not spoil.”</p>

<p>“And that is what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“The bird of sunny plumage that sings in my
heart because of the good I attempt. I met a
French pilgrim, a while ago, who spent his time mostly
in helping, as he could, to make the Mohammedan
children he met, happy. He sang to them, gave them
presents, acted as umpire in their sports, and if one got
hurt he mothered it—(that’s what he called his tender,
odd ways). Some called him wrong in his head, but
when I knew him I believed that one sane, amid thousands
crazed.”</p>

<p>“Who and what was he?”</p>

<p>“I asked him, and for reply got only this: ‘I’m
Melchisedec, a priest of the wayside, seeking to win
silver hands, silver feet, and crown jewels.’”</p>

<p>“Well, he would have frightened me, if I’d met him
speaking that way and in such moods?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he was not frightful; he seemed to attract
even the birds, and the ownerless curs ran to him when
others spurned them. He once, when sick, told me
that he came from Toul, in Lorraine, where was enshrined
an image of Madonna with a silver foot. He
believed that tradition, which declared that that presentment
of Mary gave a sign by taking a step, on a
certain time, which warned some of great impending
danger, and thereupon the member was changed to the
precious metal.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty story.”</p>

<p>“At least the lesson is honey-like. No being can
strive to help another without finding the All-Shining
often in his own soul. So our crowns are made.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Miriamne, all aglow with pleasurable excitement
and filled with a curiosity which
at times rose to very serious questioning
as to her own faith, anxiously sought to
compass an early meeting with the “Old Clock Man.”
She could not content herself to wait a chance opportunity,
and so, remembering that it was his custom at
evening time to visit, alone, for meditation various old
ruins like those of the Reservoir, she determined to
seek him there; it being not very far from her home.
With beating heart she repaired thither at sunset, the
day after the Mameluke attack. Having traversed the
Reservoir’s side some two or three hundred feet, she
was on the point of returning, for the place was very
lonely, when a voice startled her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father Adolphus, how you frighten me! I’m
so glad you came!”</p>

<p>“Looking for me, yet frightened at finding me.
Glad I came, though I scared you?”</p>

<p>“Well, men and women when frightened are glad of
the fellowship of any thing seemingly strong. It’s
easy for the terrified to believe or trust.”</p>

<p>“There’s rare philosophy in thy head, little woman.”</p>

<p>“So? What were you saying when I startled so?”</p>

<p>“That the silvering of the moon brought out thy
person beautifully. So she that sits above the moon, a
queen in heaven, would beautify thy soul if thou
shouldst elect to put on the character she ever wore.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that, knowing so little of her.”</p>

<p>“A woman’s way of saying, tell me more.”</p>

<p>“You would not torment your Mary with such repartee.”</p>

<p>“Woman again. Art thou jealous already?”</p>

<p>“Fie.”</p>

<p>“Say that again! Once the foil of one of thy sex
is penetrated, not having arguments, she can at least
say ‘fie’! Well, even ducklings hiss when helplessly
entangled.”</p>

<p>“Adolphus Von Gombard, I’ll not call you ‘father’
again, if you approach me any more in this courtier
fashion.”</p>

<p>“Again, I say, an old head; but I’d plead privilege.”</p>

<p>“At least old enough to discern the sacred line that
bounds all proper commerce between the sexes. You
plead privilege; I grant you the noblest any woman
can give, the privilege of guiding my immortal soul;
but I remember to have heard that he who would shepherd
such as I, must be to her as a woman. The relationship
between us must be as that between the
angels of heaven who neither marry nor are given in
marriage.”</p>

<p>“Some young women receive teachings most willingly
from fine-favored and patronizing instructors.”</p>

<p>“I know it; but let none patronize me so. I’ve begun
to adore the Sacrist of Bozrah, but if a breath or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
word passes that makes me think of him chiefly as
being a man, then I shall sit in his presence in fright,
or flee as I would were I to find the place changed into
a lonely night-draped waddy, my only company an
image of some leering, giant Bacchus. But this unequal
defence is painful.”</p>

<p>“Then desist and tell me what I’m to do.”</p>

<p>“You have been my ideal man, for heaven’s sake rob
me not by changing!”</p>

<p>“Right nobly spoken, daughter. Now pardon me,
for I was putting thee to a test.”</p>

<p>“A test?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s forbidden, by customs hereabout, for
man and woman, as we, alone to converse face to face;
perhaps wisely, if one be bad and the other weak.
Yet the custom is heathenish—low moral tone engendering
mighty suspicions!”</p>

<p>“Did my priest think me a heathen?”</p>

<p>“No, not that; but they say the moon makes lovers
and others mad. I was wondering whether I was dealing
with a bundle of romancings or an earnest girl?”</p>

<p>Delicately the maiden avoided the query with
another:</p>

<p>“You loved Mary: why did you not wed her?”</p>

<p>“Woman again; doomed to make all vistas end in
wedlock. With your sex love, beginning to give, gives
all readily, and seems to find no rest until there’s conjugal
union.”</p>

<p>“I have not desired to give all that way to those
I’ve loved!”</p>

<p>“It is all or nothing. Ye women love only relatives,
and never cease to desire to make all relatives whom
ye want to love. Why, girl, my Mary is a saint; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
died ages ago, after the flesh; but as a model for all
womankind lives forever,”</p>

<p>“How was she your Mary, then?”</p>

<p>“She belongs to every noble minded man as his
inspirer.”</p>

<p>“Mary—you call her Mary. I thought all the holy
and the great had uncommon names?”</p>

<p>“In fiction they do; in reality the name is nothing.”</p>

<p>“Was she wise and beautiful?”</p>

<p>“One of our most holy teachers, Epiphanius, who
lived less than four hundred years after Mary, spent
many years at Bethlehem and gathered facts that
caused him thus to write. ‘She was of middle stature,
her face oval, her eyes brilliant and of an olive tint;
her eyebrows arched and black, her hair a pale brown,
her complexion fair as wheat. She spoke little, but she
spoke freely and affably. She was grave, courteous,
tranquil. In her deportment was nothing lax or feeble.’
Saint Denis, the Areopagite, who is said to have seen
this queen of David’s house in her lifetime, declared
that she was ‘a dazzling beauty,’ that he ‘would have
adored her as a goddess had he not known that there was
but one God!’ Of this much I’m certain, my Bozrah
Miriamne, one so serene of character, and so pure,
must have reflected her inner, imperishable beauties in
her features.”</p>

<p>“Father Adolphus, you mention strange names.
There are none that sound like those revered by my
people. Do you ever hate my race? If you do you
must not teach me any doctrine.”</p>

<p>“Hate? Why, I love all peoples, and by faith I am
made a child of Abraham.”</p>

<p>“Then you are a proselyte?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not by any forms. I believe in the God of Abraham
and His Messiah. That makes me a perfect Jew.”</p>

<p>“This is strange. My mother never unfolded it to
me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, she has not yet looked into these royal mysteries?”</p>

<p>“But, good father, is your name among our chronologies?”</p>

<p>“Thanks to the God of the Patriarchs, yes; it is
with that of Moses, David, Elijah, and all the rest, in
the Lamb’s Book of Life.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In Heaven.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful; yet I’m afraid to hear more.”</p>

<p>“Shall I take thee home?”</p>

<p>“No; tell me more of Mary. You say she made
you lonely and a father?”</p>

<p>“I must then begin her history, and show thee how
and why she lived?”</p>

<p>“Do you think it will tire me?”</p>

<p>“Fear not! Her story is a poem, a picture, a tragedy;
it’s one long delight.”</p>

<p>“Then tell it to me, I pray you.”</p>

<p>So the priest proceeded:</p>

<p>“When the world was very wicked, and therefore
very sad, God in His goodness was drawn to send from
heaven a light-bearer—some one to tell man his duty
and able to win back to the Great Father mankind’s
straying affections. Thou dost know this much, and
hast read in thy sacred Scriptures how God called to
the universe, all chaotic and dark, to come forth into
beautiful form; how he said to the darkness, ‘<i>Let there
be light</i>.’ That history bears within it a fine sermon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
It’s a picture of God’s. Out of sin, darkness, confusion,
there emerged a perfect man in a Paradisiacal
home, with a perfect, beautiful woman as a help-mate
by his side. That was God’s ideal of perfection and
happiness. It delighted the Father of Joys to make
it. This is ever true; behind all clouds in God’s Providence
is sunshine, and beyond all disorders somewhere
at last will walk forth unalloyed pleasure, a Sabbath-like
rest, and fullness of harmony.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can you make me believe and feel this?”</p>

<p>“Wait patiently.”</p>

<p>“I try to do so; but I’m discouraged by the present
miseries in my family and in all our nation.”</p>

<p>“God mourns over all our sorrows before they or we
are born, but His wisdom and power of cure are faultless.
Wait. Times are mending, and the moral sphere
is dipping into the rim of light’s oceans. I think the
angels perceive the world now, as thou perceivest the
new moon.”</p>

<p>“The poetry of the words I can not interpret.”</p>

<p>“The moon’s a dark globe, with a ribbon of silver
across it.”</p>

<p>“And things have been worse; now are bettering?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly so. Believe there is a God, and thou’lt
rest in hope. Go back a little in history to when Cæsar
Augustus, of awful pagan Rome, ruled the world, having
won dominion through desolating wars. The
most educated Romans then believed in no hereafter,
and sought openly, without restraint, the grossest
pleasures. The ignorant believed in fabled monstrosities.
Rome set the fashions of all the world. The
Jews, thy people, God’s people, were lower, morally,
then, than ever they had been before. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
divided into warring families and sects, holding a few
forms and traditions, but having little heart in religion.
The rest of mankind was barbarous. Thou hast heard
how the Roman Titus overthrew Jerusalem, slaughtering
thy people by thousands, defiling their holy Temple
and seeming to blot out nearly the whole of thy race.
That time of Titus was midnight; since that the day
has been slowly advancing. Before that awful culmination
of sorrows, the Divine Trinity held august
council, and, as say the traditions of my church, determined
to bring a holy sunrise to the earth’s midnight.
The trouble of all creation was that man had fallen.
The Divine Council decreed to confound the devil, who
broke up the first home and ruined the first pure pair
by causing to emerge from another home, another pair.
They came, this time mother and Son, to be the moral
patterns for the race, the beginning of a new, sin-conquering
dispensation. The fathers hand down these
sayings: ‘The august, regal Triune Council thus decreed:
“Let us make a pure creature, dearer to us than
all others.”’ They say she was begotten upon the Sabbath,
the birth-day of the angels, whose queen she
was to be. Then one thousand of the ministering
spirits were commissioned to defend her; while Gabriel
was sent to announce the glad tidings of the birth of a
Saviour’s mother, in Hades. Her angels appeared as
young men, of majestic mien, of marvelous beauty and
pure as crystals. Their garments were like gold, richly
colored, and could not be touched any more than could
be the light of the sun.”</p>

<p>“How charming! But is this all true?” exclaimed
the maiden.</p>

<p>Without reply, the priest continued: “They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
crowned with diadems, exhaling celestial perfumes; in
their hands they bore interwoven palms; on their arms
and breasts were crosses and military devices. They
were swift of flight, some of them six-winged, like the
angels of Isaiah’s vision.”</p>

<p>“How dazzling! But is this all true?” Miriamne
persisted.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not in thy sacred books nor in mine so
written.”</p>

<p>“Then you are giving me your imaginings?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; but after the manner I have spoken, it is
recorded in revered traditions of my church, and none
can very well disprove the sayings.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if such honors made Mary proud?”</p>

<p>“A strange query.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to love one such as she, but could not if she
were haughty or lofty, like the great of earth.”</p>

<p>“It would have made such as thou proud, perhaps;
but there was none of the serpent in her whose Offspring
was to crush the serpent’s head.”</p>

<p>“Is there any of the serpent in me?”</p>

<p>“I’m not thy judge.”</p>

<p>“Then she was immaculate?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s a question for the doctors. I’m too
simple to know beyond what is written. I’m glad to
know that she rejoiced in her son, as a God and a <i>Saviour</i>!”—“She
was of noble family, though her parents
were poor,” the priest continued. “Her mother was
by name Anna, and worthy of the name, which is by
interpretation ‘<i>gracious</i>.’ Traditions of her goodness
are many, and the good and great have honored her
memory. I paid Anna homage, that of a youth respectful
of worthy motherhood, at Constantinople, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
church erected in the year 710 to commemorate that
saint. Among others, also Justinian, the Emperor,
in the year 550, dedicated a sacred place to Mary’s
mother.”</p>

<p>“Then she had her meed of praise, at last?”</p>

<p>“Tradition, though tardy, has been just; but I trust
not tradition alone. I easily reason that there must
have been much of goodness and womanly beauty in
the mother that bore such a woman as Mary. I know
that God can bring forth angels from the offscourings,
but that is not His way. He works by steps upward.
I tell thee, girl, the mother gives her life to her offspring,
and in spite of training, almost in spite of
regeneration, the characteristics of this parent will
reappear in the child. But to my story about Mary’s
parents, Jehoikim and Anna.</p>

<p>“Blessed be God, Anna and Jehoikim were untainted
by the pride of life, and, though living in a
time of loose morals, walked lovingly, constantly with
each other, through all their days. I talk to thee as
to a prudent, but not prudish, young woman. Society
is well rotted when divorce is about as common as
marriage; it was that way in Anna and Jehoikim’s
time. Why, even the exacting Pharisees then taught
that a man might divorce a wife who had lost her personal
beauty, or badly cooked her husband’s meat. Jehoikim
might have left Anna, for she was childless; that
was reason enough for divorcement to the average Jew,
then. But their love was beautiful. The man, as was
his duty, clung tenderly to his wife; her misfortune
making her all the more in need of his tenderness.
Dost thou not think so?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. I don’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pardon my earnestness; it made me forget thy
inexperience!</p>

<p>“Well, God rewarded their constancy, and they
became the parents of my Mary. The father had a
noble ancestry; but, what is better, within himself a
royal heart. He bore by right the priestly office; but
that was not much to such a man, in respect to worldly
gain. Honest priests in his time were generally poor;
the priestly preferments went, most richly laden, to
those who dealt corruptly, and truckled to the ruling
powers. Mary’s father was above sordidness and simony.
He had little to give or to leave to his beloved,
but he left his child a good name and the remembrance
of the blessed. So while God chose the humble
to confound the mighty, and serenely exalted those of
low estate, He was mindful to choose His elect from
the ranks of the morally great. Such are found in all
places and times, and when surrounded, as were these
pious parents, by the gross, low and selfish, they shine
with transcendent splendor. In Tisri, the first month
of the Jewish civic year, while the smoke of the holocausts
were ascending, to invite heaven’s pardon, Mary,
who was to bring forth the world’s greatest offering
for sin, was born at Nazareth. Her career was fore-ordained,
and she was soon walking her course of piety
and sorrow. Though inexperienced and tender-hearted,
sorrows in heaviest, grimmest forms fell upon her.
Her father died when she was, it is said, only nine
years of age; not long after, the girl knelt, a mourner,
by the bier of her mother; the golden hairs of youth
mingling, in the disheveling of utter grief, with the
gray, which crowned the queen and guide of her heart,
her mother. On the threshold of her life Mary’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
parents were called away from her, leaving her no heritage
but their precepts and example. They say that
Jehoikim’s hands were stretched out, as in benediction,
when he died, and so remained until his burial, reminding
all that his last act was a commendation of his
little daughter to Him who carries the lambs in his
bosom! The picture of these outstretched hands, and
of the girl embracing the aged dead mother, are often
in my mind; they never fail to deeply move me.
Poor orphaned lamb!”</p>

<p>Miriamne brushed away a tear, a sort of self-pitying
tear. She ran forward in mind, to the day when she,
herself, would be orphaned, without a benediction, or,
perhaps, a cheering memory. Then she questioned:</p>

<p>“Did your Mary have other friends?”</p>

<p>“Yea, her Heavenly Father. It is said, also, that
she was cared for by the elders of the people, and religiously
trained under the very shadows of the Temple.
We may readily believe this; for, in her after life, she
evinced a self-possession in adversity that witnessed of
a thorough religious culture. If there was no other
evidence, her splendid poem, the ‘<i>Magnificat</i>,’ would
convince any seeking proof, that Mary had had surpassing
benefits and privileges in the study of God’s
words, as well as in the best learning of her people,
the Jews. But, Miriamne, I’ll weary thee; let us turn
toward thy home.” Presently they stood not far from
the old stone house of Rizpah; then Von Gombard drew
from under his mantle a roll of writings. “Here, take
and read. After its perusal I’ll see thee again.” So
saying, the old priest lifted a hand in blessing, and
then moved away toward his abode.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“What so engages thee, daughter?” questioned
Rizpah, as they sat together at evening
in the old stone house.</p>

<p>“I’m reading the story of a lovely orphan
girl. I wish I were, in heart, as lovely as she.”</p>

<p>“Was she a white citadel, pure and strong?”</p>

<p>“Peerless, indeed; the very queen of women, I
think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then thou must be reading of glorious Rizpah?
Now fill me with this matter! I thirst to hear.”</p>

<p>Miriamne, though fearful of further exposing her
thoughts and study, obeyed, knowing full well that
nothing would so stimulate her mother’s curiosity as
attempted evasion.</p>

<p>“I’ve been reading of the orphan girl’s marriage.
Shall I go back, or continue from that period? Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
name was Mary, and she was a Jewess; that’s the
sum of the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Go forward,” sententiously replied the elder.</p>

<p>Miriamne complied:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The guardians and relatives of Mary determined that
she should early wed some proper person to be her protector,
and so, according to Jewish custom, they went about
the selection of a husband for her as soon as she had
reached her fourteenth year. This selection was deemed
a pious and serious duty by all the participants therein;
therefore it was made by an appeal to the Lord with lots.
Zacharias, the presiding priest, managed the proceeding,
as follows: He first inquired God’s will in prayer. An
angel brought reply, saying: ‘Go forth; call together
all the widowers among the people, and let each bring
his rod.’</p>

</div>

<p>“In truth here is refreshment! If all weddings were
contrived under the wisdom of older heads, there would
be fewer mad marriages.” Rizpah swayed back and
forth as she spoke. She was remembering, now,
the curse of Harrimai that day in Gerash, long
years before. She thought him a monster then, but
now she was enshrining him in mind by the Angel of
the Lots.</p>

<p>“Shall I go on, mother?”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“He to whom the Lord shall show a sign, let him
be husband of Mary,” read Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Ah, the Lord would not trust the youths to draw!
He knows that a man is like to harass the life out of
one woman before he learns to care for another rightly.
God was good to Mary in hedging her in to a widower
if needs be that she must marry.”</p>

<p>Rizpah did not sway back and forth now; she sat
erect and laughed bitterly.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MARRIAGE OF MARY AND JOSEPH.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Miriamne continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There were many splendid youths who rejoiced to be
permitted to bring their wands.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Oh, ho! then they were suffered to draw for the
girl? But what matter—the Angel of Lots presided!
He’d not let the youths succeed!” Again Rizpah
laughed, and as mockingly as before.</p>

<p>Miriamne again read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After prayer each deposited his almond tree with the
aged Temple priest. In the early morning they anxiously
sought the verdict. It was found that all the rods were
dead, except that of Joseph, the son of Jacob, the son of
Mathan; but his blossomed as that which, ages before, confirmed
miraculously the priesthood of Aaron’s sons. Then
there appeared another miracle, for as Joseph reached forth
his hand to take his blooming branch, there issued from
among its luxurious blossoms, miraculously, a white dove,
dazzling as snow. For a moment the dove gracefully suspended
itself in the air, turning its eyes from one to another
of the competitors; then it alighted on Joseph’s head.
‘Thou art the person chosen to take the Virgin and keep
her for the Lord,’ said the priest, solemnly, to Joseph. All
the rivals responded ‘Amen,’ and then the dove flew away
toward heaven. Joseph was thirty-three years old, of pleasing
countenance, very modest, graceful, and of comely
figure, and a widower.</p>

<p>“When all was told to Mary she modestly replied: ‘I
knew it, for the Lord has been with me.’ Zacharias told
Mary that Joseph was a true, honest Jew, a carpenter by
trade, and trained by a father who fully believed the adage
of Rabbins, which said that ‘He who would not make his
son a robber makes him a mechanic.’ ‘Besides this,’ said
the Temple priest, ‘thy espoused one is like thyself, of the
royal <i>house of David</i>. The blood of twenty kings mingle
in the veins of you both. God grant that to that house of
David there soon be born another, greater than all before,
to deliver our holy nation from foreign masters.’ Mary
made no reply, but as a blush of hopefulness passed over
her face, she looked very earnestly toward heaven and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
seemed to be repeating the prayer of the priest to the
All Father. The formal betrothal then took place. Joseph
presented his chosen bride a small token of silver, saying:
‘If thou consentest to be my bride, accept this.’ She
took it, smiling affectionately, and then the witnesses signed
the usual Jewish compact, which read as follows:</p>

<p>“‘I Joseph, said to Mary, daughter of Jehoikim, become
my wife under the law of Moses and Israel. I promise to
honor thee; to provide for thy support; thy food and thy
clothing; according to the custom of Hebrew husbands,
who honor their wives, as is befitting. I give thee at once
thy dowry and promise thee besides nourishment, and
clothing, and whatsoever shall be necessary for thee, also
conjugal friendship, a thing common to all nations of the
world. Mary consents to become the wife of Joseph,’ The
two signed the document.”</p>

</div>

<p>“See Miriamne, the Jews were wise; they made the
husbands do most of the promising. They knew that
the wives would be all wifely without such pledging.”
And Rizpah again bitterly laughed.</p>

<p>“Shall I proceed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, proceed; it’s a Jewish poem.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thereupon Joseph placed a jeweled ring upon Mary’s
fourth finger, with a smile and a blush, saying, the ‘physicians
say, my beloved, that a nerve and a vein, reaching the
heart together, lay close to the surface of that finger.’ And
she understood and was happy. A benediction was pronounced,
and then the espoused pair were ready to depart
to Joseph’s house. He was to be the guardian of the maiden
from that hour forth. The hereditary servants of the families
took up the line of march, bearing flaming torches;
immediately after these followed a procession of women,
richly garbed and wearing golden tiaras and pearl bedecked
girdles. Behind these attendants of the virgin, followed a
goodly company of dexterous musicians and singers, discoursing
rapturously the significant canticles of Solomon.
As the latter went on from time to time they broke out of the
line of march and disported themselves in the eastern star-dance,
saying as they did so, to one another, ‘the morning
stars sang at creation; the dawn of a new home coming by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
love, is next to creation the most joyous of all events.’ So
the dancers went on, and as they rejoiced in poetic motions,
they thought of the stars which yet tremble as if with the
thrilling of that first delight they shouted. Of all, the sweet
orphan girl now companioned was the center. She was bedecked
with costly jewels, the glad tributes of those that loved
her; over her was the significant veil, and, so beneath the
wedding canopy, she entered Nazareth to be a wife. Her sky
had become very bright, for hers was a heart that took
exquisite joy from the honeyed petals of affection’s flower.
No bride ever more fully entered into that supreme state,
the all exalting, entrancing, expanding, thrilling period of
new married life. She went forward in the proud consciousness
that her weakness had overcome a giant, and
that while she lead a royal captive, she was supremely happy
in her utter bestowal of her all upon the one only man now
became almost next to God in the temple of her soul.”</p>

</div>

<p>Miriamne paused, and Rizpah wept a little.</p>

<p>“Shall I go on or pause, mother?”</p>

<p>“Go on, dear.”</p>

<p>“But you weep, are you ill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, except in memory. This is sweet sorrow,
that beats us back and forth; contrasting dark endings
with bright beginnings; heaven high hopings with
black disappointments, and happy lives with our own,
all interwoven with miseries. I walked once in the sweet
illusions of bridal days, but an utter widowhood came
before death called. That’s the worst bereavement.”</p>

<p>“But some marriages are all happiness, are they
not?” queried the daughter.</p>

<p>“Some, but not many. That’s the rule. Most of
them begin well enough, but wedded mates are not
as wisely tender as lovers; they too soon entomb
all their joys in graves of selfishness and lust. So
then the dove flies from the blossom of espousal never
to return.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps, such as they did not love enough to begin
with and so separated?”</p>

<p>“Some who would die for each other before marriage,
would die to be quit of each other, after. Hence
the brood of suicides, and that blackest crime of all,
murder, which often raises its treacherous, cruel head
within the marriage chamber.”</p>

<p>“How comes this error, trouble, horror?”</p>

<p>“In wedding bodies, without consents or courtings of
the souls, if those, who, though mismated, happen to
join lives, were only wise, they might yet be happy,
growing together. But read more daughter.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the fullness of time, the angel Gabriel, known amid
the Seraphim as God’s champion, the chosen of Jehovah and
His messenger of comfort and sympathy from heaven to
man, was commissioned to carry the glorious news to earth.
He spread his rainbow pinions, and with his own radiance
to lighten his course, passed from the confines of the august
court of the Divine Presence, the companionship of his fellow
archangels, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, to go out across
the planet-lightened realms of everlasting space. His
course was watched with throbbing interest by the spirits of
mercy appointed for ministering to man. Gabriel sped on,
with sweeps of power which almost devoured distances, nor
paused to bask for a moment in the many-colored lights of
the golden and silvery shielded planets or constellations
that he passed in his rapid flight. The wheeling suns and
rushing worlds, marching and charging along the shoreless
oceans of eternal space, had no splendors nor powers with
which to challenge his high mission; though theirs was
grand, his was grander. He traveled at love’s behest, on
mercy’s work, to carry to this little earth, rolling along,
mostly in shadows, the mandate of glory, the news of
heaven’s great saving device. He bore proclamation in its
substance and its realizations forever the manifold wisdom of
God; the wonder of all who know to think or reason. And
so that voyage passed into the pages of history and the
records of eternity as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mary, whom Gabriel sought, was engaged in evening
prayer as was her wont, with her face toward Jerusalem’s
Temple.”</p>

</div>

<p>Miriamne paused; she perceived that she had arrived
at a part of the manuscript which Father Adolphus
had marked with a red line to remind her it was
from his Christian Bible. She feared to read this portion
to her mother.</p>

<p>“Read on, daughter, the words are precious; they
are as songs in the night to my soul.”</p>

<p>Miriamne continued:</p>

<p>“And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent
from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</p>

<p>“To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was
Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name
was Mary.</p>

<p>“And the angel came in unto her and said, Hail!
thou art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed
art thou among women.</p>

<p>“And when she saw him, she was troubled at his
saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation
this should be.</p>

<p>“And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for
thou hast found favor with God.</p>

<p>“And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb,
and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.”</p>

<p>Miriamne read the last word “Joshua.”</p>

<p>She proceeded:</p>

<p>“He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of
the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him
the throne of his father David.</p>

<p>“And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever;
and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be,
seeing I know not a man?</p>

<p>“And the angel answered and said unto her, The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that
Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called
the Son of God.”</p>

<p>“Hold! hold!” cried Rizpah. “What is this? the
faith of the Nazarene?”</p>

<p>Miriamne was awed. She feared she had proceeded
too far; but quickly remembering an explanation of
Father Adolphus, replied: “Be content, mother, I
read but that that appears in our holy prophets, Isaiah,
the poetic and vehement; his words you so much prize
have here an echo.”</p>

<p>Rizpah gazed at her daughter, with a puzzled, questioning
expression for a moment, and then sententiously
said, “Read on.” She was alert, though severe.
Her curiosity was ruling, but her prudence was conserved,
at least in her own mind. The daughter was
anxious, but could not retreat; she knew she must
read further or make a futile effort to explain her
reluctance. The two were a study; each afraid of the
other: each anxious to aid the other to truth; both on
guard, and, while professing to be all love for each
other, attempting to move forward to a fuller fellowship
by indirection. The outlines of the cross were
appearing in that household, and never was there to be
complete accord until there it ruled all hearts.</p>

<p>Miriamne continued to read, but confined herself
chiefly to notes made by the old priest on the margin
of her manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Presently Joseph, the affianced husband of Mary, discovered
that his beloved was to become a mother. At first
the discovery was like a dagger in his heart, for as yet the
marriage had not been consummated. It was a crisis of
great import and trial to husband and wife. Joseph, though
now a plain man and a mechanic, carried in his veins the
noblest blood of his race, being descendant of the ancient
kings and in the line of Solomon and David. Besides that,
he had all the abhorrence of the better Jews for adultery,
that their awful law of death as its penalty, implied.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Did he help the mob to stone her?” cried Rizpah.</p>

<p>Miriamne was startled by her mother’s angry earnestness.</p>

<p>“Oh! we’ll see.”</p>

<p>She continued reading:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He met his affianced in the evening on her return from
Hebron’s rosy hills, whither she had gone to visit her kinswoman,
the mother of John, by name Elizabeth. The interview
of those two noble women had prepared Mary to tell
her betrothed all that troubled and rejoiced her. When her
espoused met her privately and for the last time, as he intended,
he found her sweetly, serenely singing, as was her
wont, a Davidic psalm. He was at first astonished, not
knowing how she could be so happy under such stigma as
seemed to rest upon her. His patrician blood was roused,
and for a moment he was ready to denounce her to the
Sanhedrim as an adulteress. Then he looked at her, pitifully,
questioningly. It could not be, he meditated, that
one so young could be so depraved as to sing God praises,
being a criminal. She must be insane! He tore himself
from her presence, but instantly returned when she called
out: ‘Joseph, God knows all; touch not His anointed.’</p>

<p>“‘Woman!’ he cried ‘explain! explain! Thy seeming
sin hangs scorpions over my eyes, and turns my heart to
ashes. Thy calmness is a wonderment!’</p>

<p>“Then Mary quietly recited to him the wondrous story of
Gabriel’s visit.</p>

<p>“Joseph was pale, and reverently attentive; but still the
sadness of his countenance betokened his incredulity.</p>

<p>“Mary, self-possessed, confident in her own integrity,
continued: ‘For three months I have been secluded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
my kinswoman, Elizabeth. She knows I saw no man, and
thou canst testify of the manner of my living since our
espousal; but I got words from God, at Hebron. When I
first went into my kinswoman’s house.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>“And she spake out with a loud voice, and said,
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb.</p>

<p>“And whence <i>is</i> this to me, that the mother of my
Lord should come to me?</p>

<p>“For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation
sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb
for joy.</p>

<p>“And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be
a performance of those things which were told her
from the Lord.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No sooner had Elizabeth finished that salutation, than
the Spirit of the Most Holy Ghost possessed me and I,
thus, without premeditation prophetically said:</p>

</div>

<p>“My soul doth magnify the Lord.</p>

<p>“And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>

<p>“For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden:
for, behold, from henceforth all generations
shall call me blessed.</p>

<p>“For He that is mighty hath done to me great
things; and holy is His name.</p>

<p>“And His mercy is on them that fear him from generation
to generation.</p>

<p>“He hath shewed strength with his arm; He hath
scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>

<p>“He hath put down the mighty from their seats,
and exalted them of low degree.</p>

<p>“He hath filled the hungry with good things; and
the rich He hath sent empty away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance
of his mercy.</p>

<p>“As He spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his
seed forever.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I tarried until Elizabeth’s son was born. He is to be the
herald of mine! Joseph was amazed. The wisdom and
stately character of her <i>magnificent</i> description and ascription
were unaccountable. But he doubted still her integrity.
Yet his wrath was softened into pity a little. He
hesitated, and then, <i>being a just man and not willing to make
her a public example, was minded to put her away privately</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Ha, ha;” laughed Rizpah, bitterly; “I see now,
’tis a beautiful fable thou art reading! Put her away
privately! a man do that under such circumstances!
Bah! rather would a real man parade the woman’s
guilt from the house tops. In truth, to show that he
was sinless because he was such a Nemesis of sin; or to
get the pity of light-headed fools, who would gladly
take the place of the discarded! A pretty, baby face
can catch unerringly the man who pities himself well, if
she will only gush with real or affected pity for him. Pity
and flatter a man and he’ll be—a Lucifer! But read
it all. This is refreshing; its so absurdly uncommon!”</p>

<p>The girl continued:</p>

<p>“But while he thought on these things, behold, the
angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying,
Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto
thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her
is of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>“And she shall bring forth a son, thou shalt call his
name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their
sins.</p>

<p>“Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring
forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
which being interpreted is, God with us.</p>

<p>“Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the
angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him
his wife.”</p>

<p>Miriamne again read “Joshua” for Jesus, but yet
felt assured that her mother was in heart, recognizing
the source of the story. Rizpah, by silence, pretended
not to know she was listening to parts of the Christian
Bible, for she was very curious now. Miriamne was
willing the harmless pretense should continue. But
they furtively observed each other.</p>

<p>“I see; this is a story based upon some of the
Christian’s heresies,” interrupted Rizpah. “If the
stories be so unnatural, I’d never fear their sacred
books!”</p>

<p>Miriamne was rejoiced, for her mother was becoming
interested, and that was nigh being fully persuaded
that their home was not contaminated by the hated
Christian’s Bible. Miriamne read again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mary now was contented. She had the approval of
God and her conscience, and that for which her young
heart greatly yearned the approval of the one man of earth
whom she loved. It mattered little to her that few others
knew her wondrous secret. She knew her position was
one of peril, and yet she felt certain God would be with
her to the end. The joy of Joseph was full, and the revulsion
of feeling from crushing shame, to lofty hope was
unutterable. A while before he was ready to die, as he
began tearing from his heart its idol, and attempting to
consign her to the tomb like that of death, forgetfullness.
Now he perceived himself elect of God to defend, vouch
for and shelter the woman of women, the highly favored of
Deity.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“And it came to pass in those days that there
went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus that all the
world should be taxed.</p>

<p>“And all went to be taxed, every one into his own
city.</p>

<p>“And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the
city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem, (because he was of the
house and lineage of David,)</p>

<p>“To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife.</p>

<p>“And so it was, that, while they were there, the
days were accomplished.</p>

<p>“And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped
him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger;
because there was no room for them in the inn.”</p>

<p>“How barbarous! They surely could not have been
Jews who kept that inn, or a woman in bearing would
have had tender welcome. They must have been
Christians; they are the people whose women blush
when carrying little life, and, as if ashamed, forgetting
that God had royally privileged them, hide themselves.
Bah, I’m sick of the thought! I’ve seen Christian
husbands ashamed of their pregnant wives;” so soliloquised
Rizpah.</p>

<p>“There were no Christians at the time of these
events, mother. But shall I read of the company
Mary had, to comfort her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do; I’d like to have been there, just to rail at
the inn’s folks.”</p>

<p>Miriamne continued,</p>

<p>“And there were in the same country shepherds
abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them,
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them;
and they were sore afraid.</p>

<p>“And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold,
I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
shall be to all people.”</p>

<p>“It is said that even the cave, where Mary was, was
filled with supernal light,” remarked Miriamne digressingly.</p>

<p>“I believe it on my word. If angels ever come to
earth, it must be surely to hold glad torches about the
couches where beings, to be at last perchance like
themselves, are coming forth to life,” said Rizpah.</p>

<p>“It is thus reported,” continued Miriamne:</p>

<p>“Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea
in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came
wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</p>

<p>“Saying, Where is he that is born King of the
Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are
come to worship him.”</p>

<p>Miriamne substituted Joshua for Jesus in the reading.</p>

<p>“Joshua, ‘Joshua,’ what ‘Joshua’ is that?”</p>

<p>“Joshua means “deliverer;” this one was to be
such; for the rest, I’ve not before read it, mother.”</p>

<p>“Read on, again,” tritely, Rizpah spoke.</p>

<p>“When Herod the king had heard these things, he
was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</p>

<p>“And when he had gathered all the chief priests and
scribes of the people together, he demanded of them
where Christ should be born.</p>

<p>“And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea:
for thus it is written by the prophet,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not
the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee
shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people
Israel.</p>

<p>“Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise
men, inquired of them diligently what time the star
appeared.</p>

<p>“And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and
search diligently for the young child; and when ye
have found him, bring me word again, that I may come
and worship him also.</p>

<p>“When they had heard the king, they departed
and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before
them, till it came and stood over where the young
child was.</p>

<p>“When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding
great joy.</p>

<p>“And when they were come into the house, they
saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell
down, and worshiped him: and when they had
opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts;
gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</p>

<p>“And being warned of God in a dream that they
should not return to Herod, they departed into their
own country another way.”</p>

<p>Miriamne read ‘The Anointed’ where the text
said Christ.</p>

<p>“Miriamne, who could these men have been, Rabbins?”</p>

<p>“I think not, mother; I see upon the margin of my
‘<i>megellah</i>’ a note which says, These were light or fire-worshipers
of Persia. They, or rather their ancestors
had heard, centuries before, from the Jews, then their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
captives, that there was an expectation, based on
wondrous prophecies, that some time, there was to
be on earth a man, born of woman, in character
like God and in mission the bringer in of the golden
age. These Magi were seeking that person, like pious
pilgrims.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Messiah. Alas! we all long for His coming!”
Then Rizpah fell into a revery from which
Miriamne roused her with the question: “Art too
weary to hear more?”</p>

<p>“No, no; read, on. These things strangely move
and rest me.”</p>

<p>Miriamne continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When eight days were fulfilled, they circumcised the
Child, calling him Joshua, offering, according to the law, a
pair of turtle doves.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Circumcised? Ah, I’m glad! They were good
Jews, though poor ones, since they offered the gifts of
the poor, two pigeons,” exclaimed Rizpah.</p>

<p>Miriamne read onward:</p>

<p>“There was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting
for the consolation of Israel.</p>

<p>“And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost,
that he should not see death, before he had seen the
Lord’s Christ.</p>

<p>“And he came by the Spirit into the Temple; and
when the parents brought in the child.</p>

<p>“Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God
and said:</p>

<p>“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
according to thy word:</p>

<p>“For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which thou hast prepared before the face of all
people;</p>

<p>“A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of
thy people Israel.</p>

<p>“And Joseph and his mother marveled at these
things which were spoken of him.</p>

<p>“And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his
mother, Behold this child is set for the fall and rising
again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be
spoken against;</p>

<p>“(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul
also;) that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed.”</p>

<p>“How mysterious and contradictory, and yet how
true the old man’s word, Miriamne? He blessed the
parents amid their pious services toward their offspring,
yet predicted a sword thrust for the mother. Ah, the
sword for the mother is ever impending! But read
further.”</p>

<p>Miriamne continued:</p>

<p>“And Anna, a prophetess, who was a widow of
about fourscore and four years, which departed not
from the temple, but served God with fastings and
prayers night and day.</p>

<p>“And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise
unto the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that
looked for redemption in Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“What a finished picture, Miriamne,” interrupted
Rizpah. “See, a young mother committing her child
to God; a blessing and a sword of pain revealed;
then the finest human sympathy in the form of
motherhood chastened by years coming to encourage
her. Oh, the years have sadly wrecked a true woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
if they have put her beyond saying, from her heart:
‘Poor girl, I love thee,’ to her younger sister in her
hour of maternal trial. But what followed?”</p>

<p>Miriamne replied by again reading:</p>

<p>“The angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a
dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his
mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I
bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child
to destroy him.”</p>

<p>“Ha! the jealous old hypocrite! But I remember,
Herod murdered his wife. A man brute enough to do
that could easily seek the life of an innocent babe. If
Apollyon ever be dethroned because of the appearing
of one more devilish than himself, the dethroner
will be a wife-murderer!” exclaimed Rizpah, almost
in a passion.</p>

<p>Miriamne continued:</p>

<p>“Joseph took the young child and his mother by
night, and departed into Egypt.</p>

<p>“And was there until the death of Herod.”</p>

<p>“So Jewry, our Jewry, gave one of its young
mothers a stable for a bed chamber, a manger for her
babe; then refused her these by making her an exile.
Cruel Israel said go or be childless! Oh, Israel! how
Pagan Rome defiled thee!” passionately exclaimed the
Jewish matron.</p>

<p>Miriamne paused until the mother questioned:</p>

<p>“Was there a pursuit?”</p>

<p>“A hot one, though a vain one; my manuscript
reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Herod had charged the Magi to tell him, on their
return from their quest, the abode of the Child born under
the star. He pretended to desire to pay it homage, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
heart he was intending to murder it. The Magi, impressed
by the goodness and sanctity of mother and Infant, never
returned to Herod to betray them.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of
the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth and
slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all
the coasts thereof, from two years old and under,
according to the time which he had diligently inquired
of the wise men.</p>

<p>“Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by
Jeremy, the prophet, saying:</p>

<p>“In Ramah there was a voice heard, lamentation,
and weeping, and a great mourning, Rachel weeping
for her children, and would not be comforted, because
they are not.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So a dark wave of misery rolled over Bethlehem.
Hundreds of women, weeping over their own dead, were led
to understand the cruel injustice of the spirit that drove the
Virgin and her child into exile, and that, until the end of
time, there will be sorrow in the homes of the land that
does despite to the virtues and characteristics exemplified,
so well, by that mother and that Child.”</p>

</div>

<p>With these words Miriamne rolled up her parchment,
saying: “This is all there is written here.”</p>

<p>“All? It is well, for thou art weary, child. We’ll
now retire; to-morrow I must speak with thee about
the book. Good-night, now.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, mother.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The day following Miriamne’s readings to her
mother, she eagerly sought Father Adolphus
that she might receive more of the
narrative, delightsome to herself and evidently
interesting to her parent.</p>

<p>Finding the priest at dawn in one of his accustomed
walks amid the ruins, she scarcely waited for his
“Peace, daughter,” until she exclaimed, “More! I
want more of the story!”</p>

<p>“Hast finished that I gave thee so soon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and read it all to my mother! Is that not
wonderful?”</p>

<p>“Temerity!”</p>

<p>“No; it charms her. She has fallen in love with
the child-wife. Oh, what if my mother should come
to think and believe as you—then I would!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thou mayst alone; but what part of the story desirest
thou?”</p>

<p>“All! Nothing less than all! What became of
the Holy Family in Egypt?”</p>

<p>“Now sit down on this shattered column and I’ll
recount to thee the traditions in order, leaving thee to
judge which is true.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you believe and I’ll believe it.
That’s enough!”</p>

<p>“I scarcely am able to do that, not knowing whether
to believe or disbelieve some of the things reported.
But I remember them, and perceiving that though they
are only traditions, they are very beautiful and very
natural, I remember them with delight, that is very
near to giving them full credence.”</p>

<p>“Then, so will I do.”</p>

<p>“It may be the wise way, for I’ve believed that the
good angels who, under God, watched over the little
outcast family drifting about in strange places, have
also watched over the drifting stories of their wanderings,
letting the facts profitable for us to know, come
safely to us, though they have come without the seal
of authenticated history.”</p>

<p>“Now, I believe all this, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, ardent catechumen, listen. For three
years the queenly Mary, with her consort and child,
tarried in Egypt—”</p>

<p>“How did they subsist?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the God of the outcasts Ishmael and Elijah,
who provided water for one and bread for the other of
those two, was the One who sent the Holy Family to
Egypt with the charge that they ‘be there until He
brought them word.’ Now, thou hast learned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
when God sends any on His work He charges Himself
with their support.”</p>

<p>“Did they find friends in Egypt?”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt learn in time, daughter, that two of that
family had, as none on earth before, the secret of making
friends. They had the love-enchantment from on
high, which has been winning its way ever since over
the world. But I’ll proceed. There were in Egypt
at that time multitudes of Israelites who had sought
its refuge from the persecutions practiced toward them
nearer home. Doubtless these exiles received Joseph’s
family kindly. Also, in all the East at that time there
were many artizan leagues, banded together to aid
their fellow-craftsmen. Joseph being a carpenter, I
doubt not, found among these sympathy and help.”</p>

<p>“At what place did the family abide?”</p>

<p>“Tradition says they tarried for a considerable period
at Heliopolis, the city celebrated the world over
for its splendid temple, where centered the Egyptian
Sun worship. To me this tradition seems most reasonable,
when I remember that the child of that family
was pointed out before, by a miraculous star, which
led the Fire worshipers of Persia to his cradle. The
Fire worshipers of the far East and the Light worshipers
of Egypt were much alike in their beliefs.
They were all seeking light, and, impelled by the necessity
of man’s nature for some religion, revealed or
man-made, able to do no better, looked up to the sun,
the greatest light of which they knew. God’s hand
was in that meeting of the old and the new. There is
a tradition that when the Holy Family arrived at
Heliopolis all the idols in the Sun Temple fell on their
faces. Be that as it may, the pathos of the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
prayers of the Light worshipers moved the Divine
Mercy to send them the Sun of Righteousness, and all
the handiwork of Rhameses, at On, lies in great, grim
silent ruins, while the faith that had its germ in that
little outcast family is overspreading the earth. Alas,
poor Egypt!”</p>

<p>“Why poor Egypt?” questioned Miriamne, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Those living now are so like their ancients who, in
fright and helpless doubt, sought to save themselves
by placating both good and evil; the light struggles in
Egypt to-day, entering slowly and often retiring. Yea,
poor Egypt, I pity thee! But I digress. It is said
that the Holy Family also tarried for a season at Memphis,
on the Nile, the city where chiefly was practiced
the worship of <i>Apis</i>, the sacred bull. Thou rememberest
how Israel was nearly ruined by doing homage
to a golden calf at Sinai? That calf-worship was the
same as the Apis-worship of Egypt. The Egyptians,
in common with all mankind of old, earnestly looked
for a manifestation of God in visible form—an incarnation.
Their priests practiced on their pitiful yearnings
and credulity, and taught them to believe that
their greatest god appeared from time to time under
the form of a bull, which <i>Avatars</i> they, the priests,
claimed that they only could discover. The
Egyptians, highly esteeming endurance and passionate
vigor, readily accepted the animal pre-eminent
in these things as the abiding place and expression
of their god. The Child Jesus, the
token of a better faith, was fittingly brought, therefore,
to Egypt’s Temple of <i>Apis</i>. Thus the <i>Light and
Immortality</i> confronted that typified grossly at Memphis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and the incarnations that were as false as they
were offensive, were brought face to face with the <i>Incarnation</i>
sung by the angels. The devotees at the
fanes of Memphis degraded man by preferring the
beast. He that made man a little lower than the angels
first, afterward exalted him to sonship by appearing
garbed in the likeness of a man. Christ, at Memphis,
was to do what Moses did at Sinai.”</p>

<p>“I do not comprehend these words!”</p>

<p>“As Moses ground the golden image worshiped by
Israel to powder, so Christ came to overthrow and blot
out of the world every vestige of the religions or believings
that exalts the animal and degrades the spiritual
in man. He heralded the age of gold and fire.”</p>

<p>“And was <i>Apis</i> overthrown by the child?”</p>

<p>“Not immediately; that is not the way of Him who
knows no haste; but in His own good time its fall
came. Egypt, hoar with deep thinkings on the master
problems of life, death, eternity, did much in distant
times to color and express the beliefs of all peoples. It
became a school of religious as well as the theater of
some of their greatest, bloodiest conflicts. Let me recall
some of the steps. First, I’ll begin with the revival
of the true faith under Moses, which was the
revival of escape, the only way to preserve God’s people
from utter defilement. Thou hast read in thy
Holy writings how the conflict began between the king
and Israel’s leader:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and
said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.</i></p>

<p><i>And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall
sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord
our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not
stone us?</i></p>

<p><i>We will go three days journey into the wilderness, and
sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he shall command us.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>“Why was Moses so anxious to get away so far!”</p>

<p>“I’ll show thee; that was then a mystery, now explained.
Egypt worshiped a bull devoutly; the
Israelites were commanded to sacrifice to God a red
heifer. The color, red, was an antetype of the saving
blood to be shed on red Calvary. Moses, methinks,
desired to get away that he might reveal this sacred
mystery, so far as he discerned it, to those to whom it
was sent. Follow me now with pious, frank heart.
The Israelites antagonized the customs of Egypt
sharply by offering before God the finer, weaker animal,
and now, girl, as I read of Mary and her child
waiting about Memphis, I discern the past and that
present meeting. It seems to me that He who thundered
to Pharaoh ‘<i>let my people go</i>’ rëappears in the
form of the child, the pitying shepherd, seeking the
lost sheep amid earth’s offscourings. More, as I think
of Mary, the beautiful outcast, following the fortunes
of her Divine Child down into that dark land, and also
remember how His blood finally crimsoned her life, I
recall the red heifer offered on Israel’s ancient altars.
Mary, for the world’s sake, through her maternity, was
laid on the altar.”</p>

<p>“Father Adolphus, you dazzle and yet convince me.
How wonderful all this seems!”</p>

<p>“I see the Holy Child in Egypt, the building nation
of earth, as the founder of a new order of building.
Now follow me, child. After the garden and the wilds,
where primitive man abode, there came the Tabernacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and Temple. When man enters into the benign influences
of social life, he begins building a house to shelter
and seclude his own. When he takes God or a god
into his society he builds a temple. If there be growth
and culture he decorates his buildings, hideously at
first, æsthetically after practice. Presently he becomes
a scientific builder and a philosopher. Then to him
life is all building. He grasps the thought that he is
the architect of himself, of his character, of his future.
If his religious life is deepened he expresses all his
philosophy, all his aspirations in monuments and temples.
Moses and Solomon, in tabernacle and temple,
but repeated the deeds of Egypt. But Egypt built
under the sun, the patriarchs under the Spirit. Egypt
had done its best, reached the end of its resources,
having filled the land from the Delta to the cataracts
of the Nile with pyramidial monument and august
fanes. But building under the sun, in the light of nature
only, was building in the dark, at least half the
time. Christ, the architect of all that is enduring, confronted
the achievements of those ancients as a merciful
destroyer. He came to them to turn and overturn
that, after the ruins, their mind be turned to a building
upon and with the precious living Corner-Stone! Try
to remember all this. Christianity is on the eve of a
new building age. The crusades are ended. Now for
religious palaces! But these in turn will be thrust
aside, that all may give themselves to build souls up
for eternity!”</p>

<p>“I am dazzled good father, indeed; but oh, I can
not remember all these things! I’m like a child in my
love for stories, and I can re-tell such to my mother, as
I can not these deeper things you utter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“I forgot, child. But we priests preach by habit
everywhere!”</p>

<p>“Tell me more of Mary and Joseph and Jesus. Were
the Egyptians kind to them?”</p>

<p>“As kind as the followers of the Pharaohs to the
descendants of Joseph! No more. There was no more
room in Egypt for Jesus at His coming than there was
among His own people. But the God of Moses, ever
the living God, though opposed, may never be thwarted
nor killed!”</p>

<p>“Oh, now do not tell me these things, too deep for
me; just tell me the simple story of the sojourn in that
strange land.”</p>

<p>“So be it, girl. If I digress, recall me. They say
that the Holy Family found in that land a few to accept
them kindly. One such was a robber, who, happening
upon them, was at first about to do them violence; but
he was restrained by the demeanor of the saintly
mother, and his heart was all changed toward compassion
of the little company. Instead of robbing, he gave
them a temporary home in his mountain retreat. It is
said that he was the one to whom the child of Mary,
long after, while dying on the cross, companion in
death with that same robber, gave repentance, with the
promise of Paradise.”</p>

<p>“How good and natural!”</p>

<p>“Then there’s another legend. It is that Mary and
her loved ones were met in that strange country by
one of the world’s pilgrims of pilgrims—a gipsy, who
was a sorceress. There’s a charming little dialogue,
part in prose and part in verse, all about that meeting,
which I have here. I’ll read it. The sorceress begins
chanting:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“‘The gipsy, Zingarella, took the babe in her arms,
but then suddenly broke forth into a mournful chant,
as she held the hand of the infant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Here’s a cradle song, and a tear and a moan;</div>

<div class="verse">Here’s a flocking world and a rising light.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“‘And then suddenly falling upon her knees, the
gipsy asked alms; but this time, as never before,
with both palms extended and craving neither silver
nor gold, but eternal life. It was granted.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, father Adolphus, I’ll never forget this story.”</p>

<p>“Forget not, either, its simple lesson; the gospel
comes to the very waifs of life, and so there is help
for the sinning, wherever found, in the Holy Child; encouragement
to all holy longings in the meanest breast
of the meanest woman, once within that circle, all
radiant with the beautiful virtues of that Saviour’s
mother.”</p>

<p>“Surely, I’ll treasure this lesson, which is both balm
and heart’s ease.”</p>

<p>“I must go now, so must thou. I’ll send at noon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the Reservoir, another parchment. Let one of the lads
meet the messenger. It will be suitable for reading to
thy mother, Rizpah. Be not so soon over-hopeful.
We must proceed with her slowly. Those most needing
the light will curse it if, coming too suddenly, it
chance to dazzle. Israel still goes down all unconsciously
to Egypt for gods, and the spectacle of man
changing the invisible down, down, continues everywhere.
Slowly, we who would be faithful, must raise
up His only true presentment. We must allure after
us, with all wisdom and tenderness, those we would
win, while striving ourselves to rise toward Divine ideals
ever beyond and above us. God bless my little missionary.”</p>

<p>They parted; and there were tears on Miriamne’s
face; but not of anguish.</p>

<p>“‘And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth:
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophets. He shall be called a Nazarene.’”</p>

<p>“Nazarene!” Rizpah ejaculated, interrupting the
reader. “Does the word not taste like wormwood,
girl?”</p>

<p>The maiden replied, adroitly: “We read the pagan
inscriptions on the monuments about us without
being harmed! Surely we may safely read these
nobler peoples’ words and deeds.” So saying, the
maiden continued:</p>

<p>“‘Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at
the feast of the passover.</p>

<p>“‘And when He was twelve years old, they went up
to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned,
the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem;
and Joseph and His mother knew not of it.</p>

<p>“‘But they, supposing Him to have been in the company,
went a day’s journey; and they sought Him
among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</p>

<p>“‘And when they found Him not, they turned back
again to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</p>

<p>“‘And it came to pass that after three days they
found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the
doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</p>

<p>“‘And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding
and answers.</p>

<p>“‘And when they saw Him, they were amazed: and
His mother said unto Him, Son, why hast thou thus
dealt with us? Behold, Thy father and I have sought
Thee sorrowing.</p>

<p>“‘And He said unto them, How is it that ye sought
me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s
business?’”</p>

<p>“That was rude, was it not, daughter? Was not his
father’s business his mother’s? He was young for such
philosophy, so like that of tyrant husband.”</p>

<p>“He meant God’s business!”</p>

<p>“Then his earnestness was just. God first, kin
after—mother or husband—say I. Did the mother
gain-say him?”</p>

<p>“It is thus recorded,” replied the maiden.</p>

<p>“‘And they understood not the saying which He
spake unto them.</p>

<p>“‘And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth,
and was subject unto them; but his mother kept
all these sayings in her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘And He increased in wisdom and stature, and in
favor with God and man.’”</p>

<p>“Daughter, there was a fine spirit in that house; it
was enhaloed by the girl-wife’s character! No wonder
that the son increased in favor with God and man!
He was able to cope with the doctors mentally, yet
subjected himself to his mother. I’ll certify that he
was wonderfully like his mother. The traits of the
woman that bore him are prominent in every man of
fine measure.”</p>

<p>“And are fine daughters, like their fathers,” laughingly
questioned Miriamne, as she glanced at a reflection
of herself in a metallic mirror suspended on the
wall before her.</p>

<p>“Ah, that depends on whether they have wholesome
fathers.” Then, turning her eyes affectionately toward
her daughter, Rizpah continued: “Thou hast enough
of Hebrew in thee to leaven thee. Yet, let me plant
this in thy memory, my lamb, destined most likely
some time to lie in anguish on the altar of maternity:
Mothers determine beyond all else the fate of the world
by determining beyond all else the characters of their
offspring. Yea, girl, in the homes of industry, the bugle-calls
of the soldier, the moving orations of the holy
teacher, there are ever heard echoes of their cradle
days.” Rizpah paused, drew a long sigh, and again
broke forth: “But, alas! men and women walk in
pairs. How can the gentler of the two, alone, or
opposed by the stronger, succeed? I’ve seen paired
birds battle the sly serpent, creeping toward their birdlings,
victoriously; paired weakness triumphant over
huge danger; and I’ve seen the lords of creation dropping
serpents upon their own mates and their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
nestlings! If one would find a monstrous cruelty, he
must needs seek in human homes!” Then the speaker,
pausing, bowed herself, and sat swaying from side to
side, with her hands over her eyes. Miriamne, accustomed
to such action on her mother’s part, and knowing
it was best when she was in such moods to leave
her to herself, withdrew quietly. Yet, Rizpah seemed
not alone to herself, for her mind was peopled with
ghostly forms from her gloomy past; all painful companions,
but still courted by the woman in her periods
of morbidness. Presently she slept; the sleep of sorrow,
that mercy balm of nature which comes to pained
or wounded humanity as the power to grieve or ache
is exhausted. The sleeper passed from consciousness
of things about her, followed by the forms that had
haunted her memory, and was soon among the wonders
of dream land. Then came to her the sound of
mighty contentions, and it seemed as if opposing forces
were in conflict concerning herself. Rizpah, of the
ancient, seemed to be trying to drag the dreamer
toward seven crosses supporting seven stark forms.
The babel of contending voices was silenced by others,
exulting, as if in victory. There was a change; the
sleeper seemed to be lifted up from caverns unutterably
deep, and suffocating, upon a ruby cloud, soft as down to
the touch, but irresistible in uplifting. She was borne
swiftly, over vast realms of space, toward a golden
gate-way with tomb-like arch, whose cross-shaped
portal swung invitingly open. A river of light spreading
to a sea, and vibrating with sense-entrancing
melody, flowed outward through the mighty gate-way.
On either side of the portals, and moving along the
river, were many glorious beings. The latter soared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
on wings of mighty sweep, whose motions seemed to
beat in accord with the melody of the flowing light,
while, from within and without the gate-way, there came
the sound of countless voices, all, as it were, mingling
in the triumphant swellings of a grand anthem. The
dreamer discerned in the anthem two words, repeated
over and over, tirelessly: “<i>Glad Tidings!</i>” “<i>Glad
Tidings!</i>” “<i>Glad Tidings!</i>” The golden gate became
rose-tinted; the color deepening to purple and gold
as down the stream of light there floated an island of
gardens, and on the island appeared two human forms;
a youth and a maiden. The anthem “Glad Tidings”
continued; but sweeter, louder, deeper than before.
And the sleeper perceived that on the wings of the
glorious beings there were emblems; red crosses, about
each cross a ring of fire; above the crosses, bejeweled
silver cups; then she knew that the twain on the island
were bride and groom. The scene changed; there was
a consciousness of a flight of time. She looked again,
and on the island she beheld a mother lovingly bending
over a babe; over mother and babe tenderly bended
a man, by the pride and the affection he expressed,
attesting himself the husband and father. Rizpah was
enraptured, and in her dream she prayed the scene
might tarry. She was nigh being envious of that
happy mother. But her prayer was denied her, for
soon she was startled by a voice at her side, saying, in
tones of mournful rebuke: “Farewell, forever!”</p>

<p>The dreamer, looking about, beheld in her vision, her
ideal, Rizpah; but the latter was wonderfully changed.
Her eyes were dim and sunken; her form dwarfed,
bowed and age-shriveled. Suddenly the whole vision
faded into thin air, and Rizpah, of Bozrah, awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
filled with condemnation. Before she fully realized
that she had been dreaming, she cried out:</p>

<p>“Rizpah, oh, Rizpah, tarry a moment!”</p>

<p>Silence was her sole reply. Little by little, as she
collected her thoughts, she comprehended that her
vision, while sleeping, expressed the facts of her life
while waking. The heroine girl-wife of Nazareth, the
newer, finer, surer, truer ideal of womanhood, was
demolishing in the mind of the woman of Bozrah her
former idol, the lioness of Gibeah’s hill. She knew
this, for she found herself contrasting the two ideals,
and in mind lingering by preference and with the
greater delight about conceptions of the younger.
Then began the struggles of the giants in her conscience;
clean truth against hoar prejudices; sweet
mercy against bitter revenge; Mary of Bethlehem
against Rizpah of Gibeah. The matron of Bozrah,
usually hitherto so self-sufficient, was changing. She
felt that yearning inevitable in the career of most
women for a confidant. She could not sleep; she
could not now go down to get inspiration by standing
before the grim Rizpah-painting, in the lower room;
she was miserable, lonely and restless.</p>

<p>Mechanically, she moved toward her daughter’s chamber,
some way feeling that even a sleeper would be
company to one so lonely as herself. Rizpah, alone,
at night, in the grim, giant house, groping her way
toward Miriamne’s sleeping place, was unconsciously
illustrating her soul’s quest. She was in heart seeking
alone, and in the dark, some one to take the place of
her demolished ideal. Had the queen of women been
there, in person, Rizpah, then, would have welcomed
her. She groped her way to the maiden’s couch, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
that, as she believed, her daughter was pure and
good and loving. Could the matron have analyzed her
own feelings, she would have found that she was in
part led toward Miriamne because the latter some
way seemed like, or near to, the girl-wife who was supplanting
in the heart of Rizpah of Bozrah, the wild
Rizpah of Gibeah. A cloud passing let a flood of
silvering moonlight full on the sleeper’s couch, and
Rizpah, feasting her eyes, murmured: “I wonder
if that woman of Bethlehem were not very like this
maiden?” As the mother gazed on her offspring she
presently began noting features in the sleeper’s face
that reminded her of the absent father and husband.
She recalled him as he appeared under the palms that
night at Purim, and as he was that day he lay pale and
bleeding in her all-giving arms. The whole past, that
was delightful, came trooping up, and with it there
came the full light of an old love revived; a renaissance
of that she had supposed buried forever. Soon the
aged woman, all youthful again within, was mentally
in hot chase after the pleasure she had parted from so
hastily long years before. She was glad of her thoughts,
for they were rejoicing; glad she was alone, for the
thoughts seemed sacred. It was no use, had she willed,
to resist; so she just gave up to the impulse, and with
a half-suppressed cry, passionately twined her arms
about the sleeping girl, and covered the face of the
latter with burning kisses.</p>

<p>The maiden started up in affright, breaking the spell
that swayed her mother, but only in part at first.
Rizpah was almost angered by the awakening, which
caused the vision her soul was embracing to take swift
flight. Her first glance seemed to say to the now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
awakened girl: “Begone, intruder! Leave me for a
time alone with—” but she recovered herself, and was
silent. Yet her mind ran on after the vision. She had
not been embracing the girl, but the girl’s father, in
heart. Had he happened there then, he would have
been all-forgiven, all-welcome. So wonderful the heart
of one capable of deep loving as well as deep hating;
so wonderful the nature of such a woman as Rizpah,
when her emotions, aroused, spread their throbbing
pinions to soar at the behest of revived affection.
“Human passion,” sneeringly some may say, and
truly. But human passion is a gift of grace. When
it travels along right lines, it quickens the one enriched
by it to the noblest deeds. He whose name is Love
came to earth through the Incarnation to show the
splendor of human affection, working at its best in the
kingdom of its finest displays—the home circle. The
fate of Eden made men believe a lie, but Bethlehem
refuted that lie for all time. Rizpah turned bitterly
from the fiery, disappointing love she had experienced
to stamp all loving, except parent love, a mockery.
She had nursed her false creed, and suppressed her rebel
heart by adoration of the wintry ideal of Gibeah.
Now she was touched by a new influence, and it was to
her as the touch of spring to winter-prisoned nature.
For a few moments daughter and mother contemplated
each other; the one as if dreaming, the other full of
wilderment. Then the former quietly said: “I’ve
been very nervous to-night. I’m quieter now, and will
go to rest. Sweet dreams follow thee, daughter.”</p>

<p>The maiden composed herself to sleep, and the elder
woman passed out of the room. The latter, in going,
perceived on the floor-slab a parchment, and bore it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
away with her. She said within herself as she did so:
“It is best for Miriamne that I know of her reading.”
But, after all, she was very curious to know all about
the new matter, of which she had recently heard a
part, on her own account. The writing, that of a masculine
hand, ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miriamne</span>:—As I promised, I have herein recorded, for
the help of thy memory, further facts about the Bethlehem
Mother, <span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Keeping constantly in heart the wonderful
words of the angel Gabriel, she followed with constancy the
wanderings of her Son as He went forth to heal and preach.
She heard with pride and joy that a Dove of Peace from
heaven overshadowed Him at His baptism in Jordan; but
immediately she was plunged into anxiety, for he disappeared
from the haunts of men in a prolonged absence.
This was during the time of His temptation in the wilderness.
He returned to gladden her, but immediately set forth to new
trials, labors and dangers. The young Miracle-Worker was
denounced and driven from among the people of His youth.
Tradition points to the very place where his mother fell
fainting, when she saw the people of Nazareth dragging her
Son to a precipice by the city, with intent to cast Him down
to death. At that place of the mother’s overcoming the
Empress Helena builded the sanctuary called the ‘<i>Church of
the Terror</i>.’ But that loyal mother never wavered in her
allegiance to her Son, but, shortly after these things formally,
publicly, bravely, received baptism at His hands in Jordan,
at Bethabara. Indeed, this act on her part evinced not only
the faith of a disciple, but the zeal of motherhood; her
Son’s cause seemed to be failing, and she espoused it to
strengthen it in its most trying hour. She was willing to
dare all things to win for her Beloved a possible gain, however
small.</p>

<p>“The gathering storm grew darker about the Carpenter’s
Son, and the leaders of the people were planning His destruction;
but He pursued his work of healing and teaching
serenely; His mother constantly hovering near him to encourage
Him. She heard that John the Baptist, son of
Elizabeth, the herald of her own Child, had been slain because
he had been true to God. The harlots of the Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of Herod had procured John’s death, because that holy man
had rebuked their vices. But even this shocking event did
not overawe the mother of the Founder of the New Kingdom.
She stood in splendid contrast with the murderers of the
prophet. It was purity, almost single-handed, against lust
corseleted by the nation; two phalanxes; one of few, the
other of many; but, as common in this world, each led by
a woman. Mary, like a parent bird fluttering over her
nestling, sought by the fowler, hovered around her offspring.
She exemplified the finest, fullest utterance of
faith, ‘Jesus only,’ by determining to break up the home in
Nazareth, in order that all the family might keep near the
beloved One in His journeys. So it happened that when He
was near Capernaum, working Himself nigh unto death,
they visited Him to persuade Him to rest. Of this it is
written:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<i>While He yet talked to the people, behold, His mother
and His brethren stood without, desiring to speak with
Him.</i></p>

<p>‘<i>Then one said unto Him, Behold, thy mother and Thy
brethren stand without, desiring to speak with Thee.</i></p>

<p>‘<i>But He answered and said unto him, Who is my
mother? and who are my brethren?</i></p>

<p>‘<i>And He stretched forth His hand toward His disciples,
and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</i></p>

<p>‘<i>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is
in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</i>’</p>

</div>

<p>“To all He herein proclaimed the doctrines of His kingdom,
self-denial, and though the words seem harsh, they were
most kind, for by them He said, as it were, to His disciples:
‘Behold these all-sacrificing relatives of mine are twice related
to me; by blood and by sufferings.’ It was, on Jesus’ part,
a public adoption of His own family. As He had been publicly
adopted from on high when He typically submitted to
death in His baptism, so when He beheld His mother, having
forsaken all to be with Him, he proclaimed those that had
elected to share His sufferings His kin indeed. The sword
of His suffering bitterly wounded her when the rabble howled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
after the Healer, “<i>Thou wast born in fornication.</i>” But He,
amid all His engrossments, never forgot to minister to His
mother as a courtly, reverent, loving Son. These words of
a holy book not only speak of the workings of the providence
of God, but assure us that He that uttered them was
prompted to comfort His own widowed mother: ‘But I tell
you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of
Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six
months, when great famine was throughout all the land;</p>

<p>“‘But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta,
a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.’</p>

<p>“And now for the present I close with all holy salutations.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">A. von G.</span>”</p>

<p class="caption">THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS.</p>
</div>

<p>Rizpah was so engrossed with the matter of the letter
that she scarcely observed the initials at its end.
As she turned the letter over there fell into her lap a
pictured parchment. It represented a woman, half
kneeling and with arms outstretched toward a beautiful
child, the latter balancing, and, as it were, taking a
first lesson in walking. “That woman’s face is some
way very like that of my Miriamne’s in beauty and
thoughtfulness,” soliloquized Rizpah. Then observing
a tent in the picture, at one side and under the tent,
the form of a strong, dignified man, she again scrutinizingly
exclaimed, “In truth, that face is Harrimai’s!
How like my father!” For some time she sat considering
the group, and then again spoke to herself: “Ah,
I see, these are none other than the girl wife, husband
and child of whom Miriamne has been reading! But
what an improper legend at the bottom? ‘<i>A sword
shall pierce through thine own soul also!</i>’ A sword has
no place in that happy group!” And Rizpah still
gazed at the charming presentment. Suddenly she
started from her seat. “What’s this?” she cried as
she traced a dark cross made by the shadow of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
child’s outstretched arms and reaching from his feet to
the mother’s bending knees. “I have it now; the cross
is the sword! Some of the Nazarene heresy, the witchery
of the ‘Old Clock Man!’” Rizpah flung the picture
from her as if it were a serpent. She thought she saw
a paramount duty, and without an instant of delay she
hastened back to Miriamne, this time in angry mood—Rizpah
of Bozrah, the fanatical Nemesis of heresy.</p>

<p>“Here, girl! Whence this book of devils!”</p>

<p>Miriamne, in fright, leaped from her couch, and
Rizpah, laying hold of her arm, half dragged the bewildered,
trembling girl to the adjacent apartment.
“These?” imperiously questioned Rizpah, as she
pointed vehemently toward picture and manuscript
lying together on the floor.</p>

<p>The maiden, overcome by the suddenness of the
stormy outbreak, spoke tremblingly, pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, forgive me if I’ve done wrong! Father
Adolphus, the old—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the old wizzard! he gave them to thee,”
interrupted the mother. “Enough! ’tis as I expected;
the Christian’s doctrine of devils!”</p>

<p>Miriamne reached forth, mechanically, to take the
denounced objects, but Rizpah at once intercepted her,
spurning them with her foot.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch the leprosy! To-morrow we’ll hire
some Druses beggars to burn them!”</p>

<p>“But, mother, they are not ours; we must return at
least the painting; it cost great labor!”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me! Now, further and finally for
thee, rash girl, I’ve commands. Listen! Thou art
never again to meet or speak to that hoary-headed old
wizzard, Von Gombard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, mother—”</p>

<p>“No evasion nor compromise!”</p>

<p>“I can not treat the kind old man that way. He is
so good, and all the people, Jews and Gentiles, love
him,” pleaded Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Enough! and, in brief, meet him or speak to him
again, and I’ll disown thee! I’d drive thee, daughter
of mine though thou art, out of my home to starvation
and pray God to send all the plagues written in
His book to haunt thee, while thy life remained, rather
than tolerate heresy!”</p>

<p>So saying, Rizpah fell upon her knees, as if even
then to utter an imprecation.</p>

<p>In terror the daughter ran to her, and shielding her
eyes from the parent’s anger-distorted countenance,
she pitifully cried:</p>

<p>“Mother! Oh, mother! Don’t curse me! Save
me! save me!”</p>

<p>The elder woman’s body swayed and dilated as if
she were possessed of some furious demon, checked
and muzzled, but struggling to break forth. Evidently
the pathos of the daughter’s appeal touched
some responding chord of mercy, for the mother restrained
herself and then suddenly arose and swept
out of the bed-chamber. And yet Miriamne was not
reassured; she felt the fascination of dread. With
trembling her eyes were riveted on the open door; her
ears heard the heavy, stately, threatening, departing
footsteps, and great misery overwhelmed her. She
felt, if she could not express it, that the breakers of a
mighty wrath were heaving and tossing in that bosom
on which she had hitherto rested when in pain or
peril. She knew the meanings of those wavy motions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
so like those of the boa retiring for renewed attack.
She saw them passing up and down the form of Rizpah
as the latter went out, her eyes burning, her body
dilating. She had observed these things in her parent
before, but never as now directed toward herself.</p>

<p>In terror and anguish Miriamne fled out of the old
Giant-house. There was relief and a sense of getting
more truly under the sheltering wings of God in getting
out under the serene canopy of heaven. So, often,
the grief-stricken seek solitude, absence from all that
has crossed and hurt, separation from all earthly, in a
lonely appeal to the Holy and Loving. And so these
two women, bound to each other by the strongest human
ties, needing, because of their isolation, each other
supremely; after all, loving each other with a choice,
tried love, willing each to endure any cross, even unto
death, for the other’s weal, and both anxious to serve
God loyally, went apart. They exemplified the cross-purposes
and misunderstandings that beset and mar
life’s pilgrims. They needed sorely, both of them,
pilot and beacon; some one to inspire as well as to
exemplify all that is best in womanhood. The need
was patent, but the remedy but dimly discerned.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Midnight and moonlight were in Bozrah,
and midnight and moonlight were in
Miriamne’s heart as she wandered out into
the city. She did not see her way further
than to know it must be some direction other than
toward her home. That place all her life hitherto the
dearest spot on earth, was become her dread. As
she moved away from it she did not look back. It
seemed to her that there was an angry cloud
enveloping it; a cloud holding a furious thunderbolt.
As she went on, she rapidly passed through a series of
painful feelings; those that naturally beset the runaway
girl. First she felt very reckless, then, surprised
at her recklessness, then very lonely as if every tie
that bound her was broken, and then affrighted as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
thought of confronting the great, strange, selfish world
alone. A woman so young and so inexperienced; a
bird with half-fledged wings, thrust out of the parent
nest into a storm; altogether a pitiable creature. In
the moonlight of her conscience, after a time, she
dimly discerned a line of duty. It seemed to her that
it were best for her to turn toward the church of
Adolphus, and she resolutely turned thither. Before
the resolution she had walked aimlessly; now with
an aim and with some soul comfort. She did not
have power to analyze her feelings; had she had
such power she might have discerned the fact that
she was turning toward something her reason told her
was very good, therefore the soul comfort came as the
harbinger of conversion. As yet the moonlight within,
like that without, was not strong enough to resolve the
shadows in and about her. She knew, and that alone,
certainly, that she was miserable, wounded, bruised.
So storm-beaten, in a flight from the ancient Rizpah
and her counterpart, Rizpah of Bozrah, the maiden
naturally turned toward the place where there seemed
rest, escape; the haven known to all the troubled and
sick of the Giant city. With a great throb of joy she
at length drew nigh the Church of Adolphus. All
was silent about it; but its up-pointing spire, emblem
of eternal, aspiring hope, rest on a rock, stability—in
grand contrast with the grim ruins God’s revenges had
scattered in dire confusion all around, assured her.
She remembered then that she had heard some say
that they had been blessed beyond all telling, in hours
of trouble, by the services of that sanctuary. She perceived
that the church, from spire to portal, was
flooded with silvering moonlight, while all beyond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
around it was in shadows; then she wearily sank down
by a small porch near the great entrance. As she
sank she moaned a broken prayer: “Oh, God, take
me!” Utterly overcome, she wished for a moment for
death’s release; and death’s similitude, fainting, sometimes
sent in mercy, came over her. How long she
lay unconscious, she knew not. She was suddenly
aroused by the stroke of a muffled bell; she opened
her eyes and beheld forms gliding out of the darkness
into the chapel. For a moment she felt a superstitious
fear that chilled her. She vaguely remembered that
that bell had been wont to toll thus solemnly when
there was a funeral. Simultaneous with the thought
she questioned, Was she herself dead? But she
quickly collected her thoughts and then comprehended
that there was to be a midnight service in the chapel.
She remembered that Father Adolphus was wont to
have such, at intervals. She longed to taste the joys
within of which she had heard, and was at the same
time restrained, lest by entering she should in some
way part from her mother and the faith of her childhood
forever. Conscience and desire waged war with
each other, and the girl was too much excited to stand
still or to reason clearly. She, therefore, mechanically
moved through the open doors with the throng, out
of the darkness into the light. Once within the
place the grateful sense of peace and the splendors of
the various appointments, beyond all she had ever
before experienced, engrossed all her thoughts. The
lofty arches, the well wrought pillars, the niches, in
which were here and there saintly paintings, the lights,
disposed so as to produce an impression of seriousness
and rest, the hum of subdued voices, all came to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as balm. At the east she beheld a silver altar, velvet
draped; on either side of it lofty columns with golden
plinths and capitals; just back of the altar, in a light
that made the face of the presentment more beautiful,
she discerned the image of a woman, splendidly
robed and jewel-crowned. For a moment she thought
she was looking upon one living, for the crowned
woman was so beautiful, so much a part of the place,
and seemed so inviting. She contrasted her, in mind,
with the terrible picture of Rizpah. Just then, with
little persuasion, she could have run toward the
woman, back of the altar, and plead for sympathy. The
feeling was momentary. Little by little the truth
dawned upon her, and she thought, “this represents
the beautiful Mary of Father Von Gombard.” Then
the moonlight within the maiden’s soul began to
change into dawn. She gazed and gazed, and as she
was so engaged, her thoughts took wing for heaven and
her soul cried within itself as a babe for its mother.
She knew not her way, but she knew she needed and
yearned for a guide as pure as heaven and as serious as
God. Her meditations were interrupted when she
perceived the place growing darker about her, the
forms of the congregation now becoming like so many
moving shadows. All around her bowed their heads
as in prayer, and, impressed by the solemnity of the
place, she did likewise. There was a long silence.
The hush of death was over the place, the only
sign of life the stealthy movements of a tall, dark-robed
personage, who glided about the chancel. The
tower bell tolled again, once, twice, thrice; its muffled
tones, as they died away, being prolonged, then
caught up and borne onward with organ notes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
filled the trembling air with entrancing melody. Then
the organ tones softened and died away into subdued
minors. “How like the sighings of autumn evening
breezes, before a rain,” thought Miriamne. The place
again was full of melody, the organ being reinforced
by lutes and dulcimers, played by unseen hands. But
the worshippers were silent; all bowed, apparently, in
prayerful expectation. It was all new and exceedingly
impressive to the maiden, and she was carried
along by the spirit of the hour.</p>

<p>The draped figure passed down from behind the altar-lattice
and moved, on tip-toe, from one to another of
the worshipers. Miriamne was curious, yet frightened.
“What if he came to me?” The question she asked
herself made her tremble. If it were the priest, she
was sure he would be very kind and yet how would she
explain her absence at that hour from home? She
was alert to hear the words he spoke to others near
her, and when she did, she took courage. They
seemed just such as she needed. She knew the voice;
it was that of Father Adolphus, in the tenderness and
triumph of one filled with unearthly hopes and heavenly
sympathy. The cadence of his voice accorded
with the plaintive tones of the organ. Miriamne’s heart
fluttered like a caged bird, back and forth, from yearnings
to fears, as the priest drew nearer and nearer to
her. She yearned to hear spoken to herself his balm-like
benedictions; she feared, lest recognizing her, he
should reprove. He seemed about to pass, as if not
perceiving her. Now more intensely she yearned and
dreaded than before. She could not restrain herself,
and so she sobbed aloud like a child in pain. The
priest tenderly placed his hand on her head and softly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
said: “<i>If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to
forgive and to cleanse us from all iniquity.</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh, Father Adolphus,” she sobbed, “is this for
me?”</p>

<p>The priest started, but quickly recovered himself,
and again spoke in the same tone as before, his voice
rising in accord with a triumphant strain of the music:
“<i>He died that we might live!</i>” Miriamne clasped and
passionately kissed his hand.</p>

<p>The place had become darker, little by little; the
organ tones meanwhile growing deeper and more solemn,
while voices from an unseen choir blended with
them. Miriamne, recognizing, from the words of the
singers, the penitential Psalms, followed the worship
with deepened interest from the fifty-first to the fifty-seventh
of the sacred songs. They expressed the
pains and tempests of her own soul as they voiced
sublimely sin-beseeching pardon. The Christian and
Jew were for the moment made akin. The man at the
organ was a master of his art, and while handling the
keys of his instrument, he also played on the hearts of
his hearers. He was aiming to reproduce Calvary, its
scenes, emotions and meanings, and he succeeded. The
devout assembly, following the motive and movement
of the composition, was led mentally to realize the
journey from the Judgment Hall to the Crucifixion.
There were measured, mournful, dragging tones;
Jesus bearing his heavy cross; then followed discord
and confused uproar, the voices of a mob. Later on
there were dirges and silences, followed, as it were, by
blows and ugly cries. The nailed hands, the uplifted
cross and the sneers of those who passing wagged their
heads, were all revived to the imagination. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
these sounds, from the first, there ran along a sustained
minor strain, sometimes nearly obliterated, at other
times ruling. It was as mournful as the sigh of the
autumn winds amid the dying leaves and night rains.
In the color and movement of that minor there was
feelingly expressed the deep, poignant, undemonstrative
sorrow of the mother that followed the thorn-crowned
and scourged Son to his martyrdom. Then
came a long silence, broken only by the fleeting whispers
here and there. The worshipers were in earnest
prayer. They were at the cross, as the friends of Jesus,
in earnest communings. Again the organ broke in on
the silence; there was a rush of air as if some one
passed in rapid, terrified flight, followed by a sound
like swiftly departing footsteps; the fleeing disciples
came to the minds of the worshipers. Then the
organ tones deepened to the rumblings of approaching
thunders—heralds of a climax of catastrophies, while
above the rumblings a solitary, piercing voice, which
ended in a thrilling, agonizing cry: “<i>My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me!</i>” Following this came
peal upon peal from the organ; louder and louder;
discord and confusion; ending in mighty crashings.
The rocking earth; the earthquake; the rent veil—all
the tragedy of Cavalry—was presented in awful
realism to the minds of the kneeling worshipers.
Every light had been quenched, the temple within was
as dark as a tomb, and not a sound could be heard but
moans and penitential weepings. To one any way
superstitious and not knowing the intent of the presentment,
the whole would have seemed very like the
realm of the lost, filled with damned souls, making pitiful
last appeals to mercy; but to the worshipers there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
came a vision of a stark, dead form on a cross, standing
out vividly against the darkness of Calvary around
that cross the amazed, condemned crucifiers and a few
disciples, the latter whispering about the burial.
The realism was oppressive and some present cried out,
as if by the bier of a loved one, while some fainted
away. But the Healer was there. Father Adolphus,
with a voice full of tears, with the pathos of Him that
went down to preach hope to “the spirits in prison,”
spoke to the penitents of peace, light and glory through
faith. As the old Missioner went from one to another
the lights of the chapel, one after another, reappeared.
Presently the aged consoler stood by Miriamne: “Hast
thou felt the power of the Cross, my child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Father Adolphus, I do not know; I only know
I’m very wretched!”</p>

<p>“‘Godly sorrow worketh repentance’; but thou wert
as happy as a bird thou thoughtst and saidst a few
days ago?”</p>

<p>“I was a bird—a girl then! I’m a woman now.
I’ve lived years in hours.”</p>

<p>“Any sudden trouble?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a tempest and tempests.”</p>

<p>“Possess me of all, daughter.”</p>

<p>“I can not. It’s every thing. I seem so useless and
nobody loves me!”</p>

<p>“Thou art too young to be morbid and art greatly
beloved by <span class="smcap">One</span>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can not come to Him. I’m under His ban;
I do not honor my parents. How can I? One, my
father, I never knew. I’ve seen him through my
mother’s eyes, and to despise. Now I am afraid of
her, and my terror is poisoning the love I once felt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
her. Oh, I’m miserable, lost! Father, Father, save
me!” And the wretched girl flung her arms passionately
about the old priest.</p>

<p>“Ah, girl, I can not; but there is One that can
save.”</p>

<p>“Save, save me—one so lost?”</p>

<p>“He is a ‘Prince and a Saviour.’”</p>

<p>“I do not know Him. He can not love me, and
one must love me to save me; I’m so needy and
wicked.”</p>

<p>“Well said, and He is love. Only believe.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to believe.”</p>

<p>“Like a poor, sick babe, all need, thou, amid thy
weaknesses, hast power at least to cry.”</p>

<p>“Cry? What shall I cry?”</p>

<p>“‘Help thou mine unbelief.’”</p>

<p>Slowly, by wisely simple gospel-counsels, the aged
teacher lead the penitent girl Christward. As they
communed the congregation departed, and an attendant
lighted the lamps. Presently the music of the organ
again broke forth; but now in cheerful and triumphant
strains. Miriamne listened, and as she did, a
change came over her countenance. Her dawn was
coming.</p>

<p>“Art looking up, daughter?”</p>

<p>“This music is like spring morning melodies, and I’m
singing to it, in soul, I think.”</p>

<p>“It is the morning song of souls; the angel’s greeting
to Mary. Observe the words; first the ‘Hail
Mary’ before the wondrous birth; then the serene assurance
of the mourning mother at the grave, ‘He is
not here, He has risen.’”</p>

<p>“Ah, Adolphus, how blessed are you Christians in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
a religion all mercy, all songs, all love, and all nearness
to God!”</p>

<p>“‘Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
laden.’”</p>

<p>“I would I could hear Him say as much to me; but
I can not go, come, nor do any thing else; not even stay
away; I’m a bit of wind-drifted down!”</p>

<p>“Come all ye heavy laden,” measuredly replied the
priest.</p>

<p>“Oh, if there were some one to bear me onward;
blind and weak as I am!”</p>

<p>“He carries the lambs in His bosom!”</p>

<p>“Alas, I feel myself cowering away from His Holiness,
when I attempt to approach Him alone!”</p>

<p>“All to Him must go alone, in prayer as in death.
He meets with a plenteous mercy the confiding
ones who come by sorrows’ thorny path, as He will
meet the needy in judgment who have only faith’s plea.
Fear not to go alone; solitude has its benefits, and He
is sole accuser or excuser. The terms of His rebuke
are eternal secrets, as are the terms of His forgiveness.
They lie alone, between the Blesser and the
blessed.”</p>

<p>“Is the lovely woman there, your Mary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, child.”</p>

<p>“And she was the mother of this Saviour?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And was He like her?”</p>

<p>“He is, eternal; the ‘I Am’—not was nor shall be—always.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but is He like the woman?”</p>

<p>“In my soul I so believe, to my joy; for she was
godly, therefore, God-like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I can love Him, trust Him, and I’m sure
He’ll pity me, at least.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” piously ejaculated Father Adolphus.
Then he said: “Now child, rest; it’s too late to go
home. My sister, yonder, will care for thee till morning,
and then thou must hie to thy home. Thou yet
mayst be its peace-maker and blesser.”</p>

<p>Easter-tide came. All nature was serene and seemed
to recognize the memorial of holy, happy association.
Father Adolphus was astir early to ply his industry of
mercy for the suffering. “Poor, unhappy land, and unhappy
because so blind! Oh, man, man, how thine eyes
are holden, while fatlings, birds and flowers rejoice!”</p>

<p>“Ah, unbenumbed by sinning, they, like the cattle in
Bethlehem’s stable, are first to see the Saviour born of
woman. ‘Praise ye the Lord, beasts and all cattle,
creeping things and flying fowl. They shall not hurt
nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall
be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
cover the sea.’” Thus soliloquized the old priest as he
passed toward well-known haunts of misery in the
Giant City.</p>

<p>Miriamne was called to a late breakfast by the kindly
sister of Adolphus. The aged woman said little, but
every act seemed freighted with motherly interest, and
was like balm to the heart conscious chiefly of loneliness
and wretchedness. The maiden longed to have the
elder woman solicit her confidence, but the latter did
not respond to the mute, though manifest desire. “It
is better so. God’s work is best done in an hour like
this, when He alone is left to searching and counsel.”
So thought this aged minister. Experience under
Father Adolphus had given her this wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The coming of evening brought to the little religious
house its master all cheerful, yet well wearied by a
day of ministering for God.</p>

<p>“Art here yet, daughter?” was his first greeting.</p>

<p>“Yes; where else should I be? I’m friendless, lost,
unhappy; even to a vague longing for death; but I’m
frightened at that longing, since it seems as if I was as
friendless in Heaven as on earth. Oh, it’s awful to be
a two-fold orphan!”</p>

<p>Just then the church-bell rang forth a merry
peal.</p>

<p>Miriamne looked a question, and the old priest continued:
“Hark, it’s the pæan of peace, declaring that
the Day Spring from on high has visited all those in
the shadow of death.”</p>

<p>“Another service?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the best of all. We cling to the hours of this
day and battle night away in joy, thus declaring our
hope in the resurrection, the end of all nights. Listen,
that’s my organ, the one I myself made.”</p>

<p>Miriamne listened, and there was wafted to her an
Easter anthem; at intervals containing the sentence:
“Thou that takest away the sins of the world have
mercy.”</p>

<p>As they passed into the chapel, the maiden remarked:
“There are more women here than there were
at the other service?”</p>

<p>“The other celebrated death; the chief pain-maker
of woman’s life; for they live in love whose ties are
constantly sundered by man’s last enemy. They are
allured by the beautiful things, the joys, the hopes of
our Easter service. It proclaims eternal victory over
the destroyer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>“How beautiful the woman’s form back of the
altar, good Father, to-night.”</p>

<p>“Our moods within appear to us on objects without.
So strangely the Kingdom of Heaven, beginning
in the soul, spreads everywhere. It is natural, though
to think that the resurrection time brought all joy to
the childless mother: to this one as it did and does
bring a thousand times to other mothers, like her bereaved.”</p>

<p>The Easter service went onward, a succession of
joys; the march of a pilgrim army with the goals in
view; the triumph of truth, the crowning of life, the
final discomfiture of death. Miriamne brightened as
the service advanced; then came a fullness of joy; then
a reaction and she finally fell into a sleep akin to a
trance. It was the resting of the wounded on the way
of healing. There was a Divine overpouring and a
babe-like sleep of perfect trust; from this the voice
of the priest aroused her!</p>

<p>“Miriamne seems to rest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, such a dream! I followed the songs to the
sky and wished my body had wings. God lifted me up
and I slept, dreaming myself into His presence. I
thought I was in heaven.”</p>

<p>“Thou art near it, child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this wonderful calm! What makes me so
happy?”</p>

<p>“Hast thou any token?”</p>

<p>“I do not know: I murmured as the people sang
these words: ‘<i>I know that my Redeemer liveth</i>;’ as I
murmured that, every thing, got brighter, and I felt no
more under the yoke and load!”</p>

<p>“He is thy Vindicator. ’Tis well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Then tears coursed down the old man’s face.</p>

<p>And so the girl that fled out of her home, away
from the phantom of Rizpah of the ancients, away
from her mother; a pilgrim; all wants, all yearnings,
in a few brief hours, had found a city of refuge, an
everlasting hope and was in soul serenely resting.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Miriamne, the day after her conversion, at
evening, was sitting in the portal of the
church at Bozrah, musing. “Oh, how I
thank Father Adolphus for showing me the
way to this peace!” The western sky, to the maiden’s
rapt imagination, seemed very like the gate of
Heaven, and in her meditations she exclaimed as if
talking to those in glory, yet near to her: “Mother of
my Saviour, I need a mother! Thou and I, two
women, loved of the same Lord, shall we not evermore
be friends?” Then the stars glittered through the fading
sun light like night-lamps, set along the parapets of
that far off city, and the maiden felt as if heaven’s
doors were being shut. She was oppressed with a
sense of being left alone, and thereupon cried out,
“Oh, Jesus, Jesus, do not leave me here in the dark;
Oh! thou mother, sainted and happy, may I not be
where thou art until morning?” The cry or prayer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the girl, having in it much of the poet, little of the
skilled theologian, was one likely to be censured by
those adept in stately forms, and yet it was very
natural. Miriamne was but an infant in experience
and had yet to learn that after the resurrection came
Pentecost; then the Ascension. Steps like these are
in the believer’s experience; conversion is a rising from
the dead to be followed by the assuring work of the
Holy Spirit, then Heaven. But the soul quickened from
the charnel-house of sin and inducted, not only into a new
inner life but into a new fellowship, hungers for more
and more. Hence, it is a common thing for the young
convert to wish to die, and be away from life’s turmoils
and defilements at once and with the glorified, immediately,
forever. It is as if the disciple would pass at
once from the sepulcher directly up the Mount of Ascension.
In this spirit Mary Magdalene pressed forward
to embrace to her human heart the newly risen Saviour
that morning when he tenderly restrained her. There
was something for her to be and do before the final rest
on the Divine bosom, in unending rapture. “<i>Touch
me not; for I am not yet ascended</i>,” as if He would
say, “I myself, have other work yet, before the eternal
gates are lifted up for my triumphal entrance as the
King of Glory.” “<i>Go to my brethren, and say unto
them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father.</i>” The
master words were, “Go;” “say.” The load Jesus
put on His followers was the same in kind, though infinitely
less, that He took on Himself. Some way it
was love burdening with blessing, for He that in dying
agony sent the Rose of His heart, Mary, to the home
of John instead of at once to Paradise, knew surely
that then for her that was best. “To go” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
“tell” was best for Magdalene, as to stay and work for
a time is best for all:</p>

<p>So Miriamne’s prayer, though so worded that it
would have been censured by the learned churchmen,
was heard in heaven, and He that said: “My peace I
leave with you,” ministered, all unseen by human eye,
to that lamb, bleating alone amid the dark giant castles
of Bashan and the darker castles of fears that
hover not far from each new-born of His Kingdom.
She passed from repining, from morbidly wishing to
die and from thoughts solely of her own weal, to the
second stage of experience; that stage, where the
young convert is influenced with a burning zeal to tell
of the blessings found and thereby win others for the
Saviour. Miriamne soon felt desire inexpressible to run
and tell others of her joy. Then her mind recurred to
her father, living somewhere far to the westward, just beneath
where she had fancied the gates of heaven were
a little while ago. “No, no; I cannot go yet! I must
stay here and do something. Oh, I’d be ashamed to
go to heaven and leave my father, my mother, my
brothers, my people in their misery!” As she thus
spoke she pulled her hand quickly down by her side.
The motion like to one pulling away from some leading
influence. A voice at hand spoke: “Behold, he that
keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.”</p>

<p>Miriamne, with a slight startled exclamation, turned
to see whence the voice and with joy beheld Father
Adolphus.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Father, I’m glad you came this way! I
want to tell you above all others how happy you made
me.”</p>

<p>Solemnly and tenderly the old man replied: “‘Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
unto us, oh Lord; not unto us, but unto thy name
give glory, for thy mercy and for thy truth’s sake.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, He has done it; but you helped, good teacher;
and I am so happy! Oh, I do not know myself! I
feel so changed. I’m growing wiser, happier and
stronger every minute.”</p>

<p>“If so, then, He that called thee, daughter, had a
purpose.”</p>

<p>“I know it; see it; feel it. I’m called to help my
people; to bring together Sir Charleroy and Rizpah.”</p>

<p>“Say ‘my parents’; it’s more filial.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s so strange. I call them in my mind
now all the time by their names. It seems as if I belonged
to another family; that of Jesus, Mary and the
Angels.”</p>

<p>“A child of the Kingdom, indeed! When thy
parents are converted, the family tie will be revived.
Thou dost feel the love of heaven; the great eternal
family bond, as Christ when he said: ‘My mother and
my brethren are these which hear the word of God
and do it.’”</p>

<p>“But if I hope to bring my parents together I must
go first to my father and persuade him. I know my
mother will object to the journey. Can I disobey her
and still please God?”</p>

<p>“Ask God. I have for thee, and already see thy
way. I have already acted in this matter.”</p>

<p>“I can not forget the law in that I learn that ‘He
that setteth lightly by his father or his mother is
cursed.’ Among our noble ancients, the Maccabees,
the disobedient child was even stoned to death.”</p>

<p>“But thy salvation puts thee under the Gospel,
although, under the Law even parents had duties; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
were forbidden to make their children walk through
the idolatrous fires. What says Jesus to thee?”</p>

<p>“I do not know whether it be His spirit or not;
yet all the time I hear a voice within me saying:
‘These twain shall be one.’”</p>

<p>“I see thy soul abhors this actual divorcement of
thy parents. Oh, how some play hide and seek with
their consciences around forms as these do; not comforting
but hating each other; not bearing together their
common burdens; wide seas between them, yet fancying
they have violated no law of God, because they
have not asked the law of man to do what it never
can, truly, proclaim two, neither having committed
the deadly sin, apart.”</p>

<p>“This separate living is their constant sin?”</p>

<p>“He that starts wrongly repeats the wrong anew
each time that, by act or thought, he approves the
wrong first done. Sin’s name is truly legion.”</p>

<p>“What an awful thing is sin!”</p>

<p>“True, daughter. It blinds its victims here, and its
wages hereafter is death.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I fear to disobey my mother; what if
it be sin to do so?”</p>

<p>“The command, my child, is ‘children obey your
parents—<i>in the Lord</i>.”</p>

<p>“What does ‘in the Lord’ mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell thee, my little catechumen; there comes a
time to some youths, in pious life, when duty to God
compels disobedience of parents; as it came to Jonathan,
son of Saul. God is Father and mother to the
righteous, and His law must be first. Mary left home
and every thing, first and last, to follow Jesus. Her
way was the Christian’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought once I was right in obeying my mother
without question. Now I think I may be right in disobeying
without question. The old and the new law
are at war within me.”</p>

<p>“Amid these Bashan hills Paul, the Holy Saint,
traveled, led of God from thinking that directly
opposite to his former beliefs, the truth. Jesus met
him then on the way to Damascus, in power and in
glory; Paul had been for a long time a profound
scholar, a Pharisee of thy people. On this journey,
enlightened by the spirit, he asked and learned sincerely
to ask, the question of questions in this life; ‘<i>Lord what
wilt thou have me to do?</i>’ I beseech thee to ask it
daughter, as thy hourly prayer.”</p>

<p>“Did God answer Paul?”</p>

<p>“Yea.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“The blessed apostle tells all! ‘When it pleased
God who separated me from my mother’s womb
to reveal His son in me, that I might preach among
the heathen, immediately I conferred not with flesh
and blood, ... but I went into Arabia.’ Neither wife,
friend, child, nor Ephesian Elders, clinging with tears,
could hold him back from duty. Then he preached
through this wild country.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not Paul, and only a woman.”</p>

<p>“‘Only a woman!’ She out of whom went seven
devils, a woman, was the herald of the resurrection,
and the church; God’s glory in the earth, is likened
unto a woman. Oh, when a woman is clothed with
the Sun, there is nothing more resplendent, and as for
power, naught prevails against her. It seems to me if
thou dost emulate her who said to God’s messenger:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
‘<i>Be it unto me according to thy word</i>’ thou wilt go ere
long to thy father; but thou must now return!”</p>

<p>“Return whither? This spot of all earth alone tolerates
me!”</p>

<p>“No, that’s changed! Thou art the Child of a King.
Go home; ay, rise to tell of the One that hath risen in
thy heart.”</p>

<p>“Dare I? Must I?” Miriamne soon answered, by
action, her own questions.</p>

<p>The young woman started homeward; at first with
fearfulness. Then there came to her great calmness
and courage, as she thought: “If I was wrong in going,
I’m right in returning. My mother scared me from
home into God’s arms. I can tell her that.” The new
life had quickened within her the springs of affection.
In all her life before she had not been so long apart
from her mother. She said to herself, “I’ll just spring
into her arms, when I meet her!” And she would
have, if permitted.</p>

<p>The mother with a face like a stone, emotionless,
saw her approach. When the latter stood by the
threshold, the parent freezingly said: “Well; what
dost thou want here?”</p>

<p>A dozen answers pressed for utterance. Some like
those shaped by an angry or reckless girl; some such
as might come to a politic woman, having recourse
ever to cunning against the odds of power. The first
thoughts were not of love, the last not of truth. In an
instant Miriamne remembered her new personality.
She was the missionary! She dared, being right, face
any thing, even her mother’s wrath; but in her soul
she dared not let bitterness rule. She knew as well
that she dared not tell the truth so as to convey a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
false impression. She might have done so once; but
not now. “Lord what wilt thou have me to do?” the
golden prayer was on her lips and she had instant grace
to say quietly: “I was doing no wrong.”</p>

<p>“Was where?”</p>

<p>How brave the girl had become. Her reply was
calm and courageous. “I was, for a time praying to
God; but safe, for God was with me in the Spirit and
good Father Adolphus in the flesh.”</p>

<p>“The Old Clock Man!”</p>

<p>“Yea.”</p>

<p>“The wizard! I so suspected. Here is more of
this bad work;” and Rizpah angrily thrust before
Miriamne a scroll. “That fawning, heretic-priest came
here and left this with mock piety saying: ‘I, being the
mother, might read it!’ I had no humor to converse
with him; but of thee I demand the full meaning.
Now, no avoidance, girl; dost thou hear!” Miriamne
was not only not abashed, but in her new-found courage
took the letter, and without a quaver of the voice,
read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“TO THE GRAND MASTER OF THE TEMPLE, LONDON.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<i>Faithful Knight and Son of the Church</i>:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Greeting</span>—I herewith commend to thee and thy most
pious and chivalrous offices, my beloved catechumen,
Miriamne de Griffin, of Bozrah. She is the truly noble
daughter of an English nobleman, now living somewhere in
London. He is, I fear, prodigal toward God, and an exile
from his family; perhaps in the distress of bodily ailment,
most grievous. Prompted by holy desires, this young
woman, whom I commend, may come to thy city in the
hope of finding her father, for the compassing of his restoration
to health, his family and righteousness. Had I the
power, I would command the thousand liveried angels, said
ever to attend the Holy Virgin, to encompass ever this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
sweet and pious daughter of Knight de Griffin; but being
impotent to direct the angel guard, I serenely commit my
daughter in the spirit, to the watch, care and chivalrous
regard of thyself and thy companion knights.</p>

<p>“All saints salute thee. My benediction be on thee. <i>In
pace.</i></p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Adolphus Von Gombard.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>“And <i>thou</i> dost think thou couldst go alone, half
round the world, find that renegade wanderer, bring
him here, make him good, tolerable, and re-unite our
family? <span class="smcap">Thou?</span>” Rizpah stopped, her voice almost
at the pitch of a scream; her utterance ending in a
groan that died with a hiss.</p>

<p>Miriamne responded calmly: “I can not tell what I
may achieve, that is with God; but I know what I
must attempt. The path of duty is clear, and I enter
it unwaveringly.”</p>

<p>“And I, as unwaveringly, forbid.”</p>

<p>“I expected this command, and in all love for thee,
my mother, shall disobey it.”</p>

<p>Rizpah turned pale, her eyes became leaden. She
was for an instant like one stunned by a sudden, heavy
blow, and disarmed. The little submissive child that
she deemed her daughter to be, was suddenly transformed
before her; changed in fact to a firm, strong,
brave woman. But the elder quickly recovered, and
while clearly perceiving that violence would be futile,
had recourse to the last arm of the half-defeated, to
ridicule.</p>

<p>“Disobedience, oh, I see, this is a part of this superior
religion of thine and that old ‘Old Clock Man;’
this Gombard, ha! ha! It was always so. New religions
please by freeing from law! What an old idiot
that Solomon of the ancients! He taught ‘forsake not
the law of thy mother.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother, I have two parents and obligations to
both. I find our home shattered, and I for most of
my life half orphan. I have thereby great and lasting
loss. My brothers and you suffer as well. I am led of
God, in a desire to seek a remedy for our troubles. I
would gladly obey your edicts, but first I must obey my
Maker and King.”</p>

<p>“Girl, false teachings lure thee to a curse.”</p>

<p>“You know mother, you yourself cursed the memory
of Herod not long ago, when we wandered amid the
ruins at Kauawat and saw the remnants of his image,
as angry Christians left it, shattered years ago. That
day you said a curse on him that broke up families or
made innocents mourn, whether he lived anciently or
now.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I say a curse, bitter, on every act that breaks up
or beclouds a home! But not I, it is God that
curses!”</p>

<p>Rizpah was speechless and withdrew from the room,
motioning silence with a stately, angry wave of her
hand. She was defeated in the debate, but not subdued.
The next day Rizpah renewed the subject, but
this time adopting the tactics of kindness.</p>

<p>“My darling, since yesterday I’ve been thinking thy
good intentions worthy of approval for their spirit of
love. I’d approve thy purpose did I not forsee that
the great sacrifice on thy part would be fruitless. Thy
father and I could never live together! If thou
foundst him thou couldst not love him as he is, and, as
for reforming him, that were impossible!”</p>

<p>“I must try.”</p>

<p>“’Tis useless; a woman as wise, as patient, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
earnestly seeking that result as thou, gave years of devotion,
deep as her life, to that purpose. They failed
utterly.”</p>

<p>“Was that woman my mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, listen. In the glorious romances of youth I
met Sir Charleroy. I pitied him coming to our house a
defeated Crusader, a refugee. Pity gave way to admiration.
There were few about me whom I could love;
I had no mother. In some way I gave him her part of
my heart first, then the rest of it. I admired him for
his soldier-like bravery. He was older and vastly wiser
than I. All my ambitions seemed to be satisfied in
climbing up with his thoughts. He was able to teach
me a thousand things I never before heard of. Heart
and mind were intoxicated. I unconditionally surrendered
all to him, with an almost worshipful devotion.
I could not have made a more complete committal if
my God had come in human form and sought me for
His everlasting companionship. I fled with him from
my father’s home. In the wild Lejah and this Bozrah
we lived for a time together, until he changed from
lover to hater! Here my unnatural love was murdered
by inches. I can now reason better than then, and yet
the past seems like a nightmare. Thy father knew a
great deal, intended to be kind but did not comprehend
the dangerous responsibility of taking to his care
such a passionate, imaginative, impressible creature as
I was. He did not realize that there is a period in a
woman’s life when she may be literally made into another
being. In every generation women are walking
by thousands through a sort of passion week. I walked
in mine, ready to be molded almost into any form; but
he tried to have me profess to be a Christian, live like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
devotee of Astarte and be as Anata of the Assyrians
to her husband, but the echo of himself. I might have
done all this, but he tried to hasten me by force, and
then all fell to ruins like those amid which we lived.
That glorious structure of love which romance built,
became the saddest ruin here in those days.</p>

<p>“I was then a young woman, just entering the perilous,
exhaustive periods of maternity. I was weak and
nervous, and sometimes may have tried his patience,
but I thought then that he ought to have borne with
me. I am now certain he ought. After he left, I was
for a time glad. I had renewed freedom from arguments,
rasping and crossing of purposes. Then I felt
the martyr’s joy. I felt I was left, a girl-wife, with
babe in arms, to battle alone, for God’s sake, for thy
sake. It seemed often that the arching heavens
above were smiling upon baby and me; that sustained
me. But, daughter, my moral training had been as
thorough as has been thine. My idea of the solemnity
and life-bindingness of the marriage tie could be no
higher than it was. I believed it divine to be forgiving,
and finally was impelled to turn from our broken
home, to find, if possible, my recreant spouse. Dominated
by convictions of duty, and often by a revived,
wild, soul-possessing love for Sir Charleroy, I went to
far off, strange London, I hunted out Sir Charleroy
and was ready to be all things, any thing for his sake.
He received me tenderly, only to soon change to
cruelty. Your brothers were born there, adding to my
load new burdens; but I was without help. He never
seemed to study my comfort, pleasure nor needs. In a
nation of strangers, with strange ways, I was alone.
He knew scores; I knew only that one man. Repulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
by him I drank again and again the depths of misery,
having no heart in all the great city to counsel nor
love me. Then thy father took delight in vice. I was
crucified for months; my only comfort communing in
memory with the Sir Charleroy that had been, the
tender, loving, brave Palestine knight. In those dark
days, I found there was a place where persecuted
Israelites secretly met; a sort of cleft-rock synagogue.
Thither I went for consolation. I was wedded anew to
my religion, because it was mother, father, husband
and all to me; when there was none but God left to
me. I came to long, daily, for the time to go to that
meeting place of a few Hebrews just to pray God for
two things. One, the most pitiful of prayers for a
mother, that He would care for my children and keep
them from being like their father; the other that I
might be permitted soon to die! Thy father grew
constantly more brutal, taciturn and fitful! At last I
had an explanation. I found by unmistakable signs that
he was going mad. I saw further that that madness
took the shape of a murderous antipathy for me and
the children. Under the advice of the rabbi, leader of
our people at London, I determined, as the only
alternative, to return to our Bozrah home and leave
him to the care of his companion knights. In blank,
leaden grief I left London. I came to these scenes of
desolation with a heart as broken as any that ever survived
its pains. I could have died. I returned, my fate
fixed, the cup of my retribution for having disobeyed
my parent full. Once a queenly, blithesome girl,
petted and loved by hundreds, changed to a lone, sad
widow and prematurely old. A wife without a husband,
a Jew without the recognition of my people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
How utterly isolated! Thou know’st the rest, daughter.”</p>

<p>The two women were silent. Miriamne was moved
by the revelation to a wondrous pity; but her royal
sentence: “<i>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</i>”
seemed to be written on the air just before her uplifted
eyes.</p>

<p>Then questioned the elder, “And thou my daughter,
a woman, wilt not also leave me? It’s a woman’s heart
that pitifully questions.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never forsake my mother!”</p>

<p>“And never leave?”</p>

<p>“Except, only as God commissions!”</p>

<p>“Oh, say that thou wilt never leave me in life! I
said this in cruel pains for thee, Miriamne. Miriamne,
daughter, here by the couch in which thou wert born,
I plead.” So saying the mother dropped on one knee,
flung one arm over the bed by her side, and stretched
out the other toward her daughter.</p>

<p>The maiden was profoundly moved, her loving heart
seemed to be swelling within her, all her emotional nature
ready to exclaim, “I’ll tarry,” but again her royal
sentence: “<i>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</i>”
controlled.</p>

<p>“Loved mother, I am not my own. God has bought
me, and in His dear love I go. The story of sorrow
I’ve just heard confirms me in my purpose. I’m called,
I know, to work out a new and brighter day for mother
and father!”</p>

<p>Rizpah was both pained and chagrined, and burying
her face in her <i>pepulum</i> moaned, “God, pity me!”</p>

<p>“He does, I know, and sends a daughter to bear thee
proof, my mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother, as if not hearing the latter words, continued,
growing vehement: “The necromancy of that
Nazarine priest has hastened the workings of heredity’s
curse! Girl, thy father’s distemper is taking
root in thy brain; thou too, art going mad! This
scheme of peril, foredoomed to failure, is worthy of a
bedlamite only. Oh, Jehovah, my shepherd, thou
lead’st me now by bitter waters!”</p>

<p>“Mother, you called me at my birth, ‘Marah,’ ‘bitterness.’
You know how the people murmured by the
bitter springs of Marah, in the wilderness, but God
showed Moses a tree that sweetened the water. I’ve
seen that tree and felt its power. It grows on the
mount called Calvary, and is immortal.”</p>

<p>“Be considerate now, daughter, since I meet thee
kindly. To one not believing thy Nazarene doctrine,
it is useless to appeal with Christian figures.”</p>

<p>“Well, mother, you remember Jeptha? He had a
daughter, and she was all-influential with him.”</p>

<p>“He was the cause of her death, as thy father will
be of thine.”</p>

<p>“But Jeptha’s daughter became a heroine.”</p>

<p>“When dost thou depart?” questioned Rizpah.</p>

<p>“Next Lord’s day I say my last prayers in Bozrah.”</p>

<p>“Farewell. As well now as later. I can not bear a
long parting, and after to-day we shall speak no more
of this.” Miriamne was amazed by the sudden
change.</p>

<p>“Do I go in peace?”</p>

<p>“Ah, daughter, what a question? A mother’s undiminished
love will follow thee even unto death, winging
a thousand daily prayers to Israel’s Shepherd in thy
behalf. Yet, I shall condemn thy going, rebuke thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
disobedience, perhaps frown upon thee, and even say,
‘I disown thee!’ But, though I do all this, there
will be tears in my voice and kisses in my heart, for
my first-born. All my authority as a mother cries
against thy going, and all my mother-heart embraces.
I’ll not kiss thee as thou departest, but waft hundreds
after thee when thou art gone. I’m not Rizpah, devotee
of Rizpah now. I’m only a woman, a parent, a
voice uttering two decrees; one of the head and one of
the heart!”</p>

<p>Miriamne was inexpressibly rejoiced by the words
she had heard, as they betokened the breaking down
of the strong opposition to her purpose; but she could
not trust herself further than to say, as she affectionately
embraced her mother, “And I can only cry as
did that noble Bethlehem mother to God’s messenger:
‘<i>Be it unto me according to thy word.</i>’ He leads,
I follow.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Miriamne’s welcome at the “Retreat of
the Palestineans,” at London, was most
cordial. The Grand Master of the returned
knights and his wife received her as a
daughter; the companion knights vied with each other
in efforts to serve the child of their once honored
comrade, Sir Charleroy de Griffin. But the maiden
never for a moment lost sight of her mission. No
sooner had she been bidden to rest than she questioned
as to her father’s welfare. The Grand Master
attempted to assure her that she might recuperate after
her journey, but she only the more urged her desire to
be taken to her parent at once.</p>

<p>“Worthy Master, dalliance would not be rest, but
torture, to me. Being now so near my father, I’m
filled with a ruling, all-exciting longing to see him, at
once!”</p>

<p>“Be patient, daughter, for a little season; all is done
for him that can be. The princely revenues of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
knights of Europe are at the behest of each of our
veterans, as he hath need.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but your wealth can not provide him what I
bring—a daughter’s love!”</p>

<p>“And yet, daughter, since you press me, I must explain
that he is under a cloud which would make thy
offering vain at present.”</p>

<p>“There is no need, kind commander, to make evasive
explanations. I have been forewarned of my father’s
troubles of mind.”</p>

<p>“But he is violent at times, and we are compelled to
keep him secluded in the asylum of our brotherhood.”</p>

<p>“Good Master, that but the more increases my ardor
to hasten a meeting with him. I want to try the cure
of love upon him; I’ve all faith in its efficacy. When
may I go?”</p>

<p>The foregoing was a sample of Miriamne’s words
each day. Her appeals touched all hearts and finally
over-persuaded the medical attendants, who, in fact,
began to fear lest refusal would unsettle the maiden’s
mind. She was all vehemence and urgency on this
subject.</p>

<p>The meeting was a sorrowful and brief one.</p>

<p>She was not prepared for such a spectacle as her
father presented, and her cry, “Take me to him,” was
changed to one more vehement now:</p>

<p>“Take me away!”</p>

<p>Terror supplemented her utter disappointment. To
both feelings there was added a sense of humiliation.
She imagined her return to Bozrah, empty-handed;
the possible gibes of her mother and others. Her
great faith seemed fruitless and her enthusiasm ebbed.
Then she began to question within herself whether or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
not, after all, the new faith she had embraced was not
a splendid illusion! She was in “Doubting Castle,”
with “Giant Despair,” and the mighty, impelling
question, “What wilt Thou have me to do?” little by
little lost its grip on her will. It had seemed to her
the voice of God; now it seemed little more than the
echo of words heard in a dream. She was moved now
by a desire to get away from something, but she could
not define the thing. Certainly she desired to escape
her disappointment, but not knowing how, she sought
to get away from its scene. If she could have run
away from herself she would have been glad to have
done so. She fled from the asylum, as soon as night
came to hide her flight. She had not strength to go
far, and the Asylum park of many acres of lawns and
groves, afforded her solitude; that that she now chiefly
desired. The night the desolate girl thus went forth
was a lovely one; a reflection of that other night of
sorrow when she fled from the old stone-house home
to the chapel of Adolphus at Bozrah. And the memory
of that night returned to the girl with some consoling.
Again she looked up to the firmament and
was calmed by the eternal rest that seemed on all
above, and again she yearned to go up further to the
only seeming haven of righteousness and peace.</p>

<p>Then came the reaction; the prolonged tension had
done its work, and the young woman dropped down on
the earth. How long she lay in her blank dream she
knew not. If during its continuance she in part recovered
consciousness, she had no desire nor strength to
rise or throw off her weakness.</p>

<p>Ere long her absence was known at the Grand Master’s
and an eager search was instituted. Foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
in the quest was the young chaplain of the knights
and his quest brought him first to the object of search.</p>

<p>“Can I aid my lady?” said the chaplain, in kindly
tones, standing a little distance away from her, in part
through a feeling of delicacy akin to bashfulness, and
in part fearing lest by any means he should affright her.</p>

<p>The young woman lay motionless; her eyes closed;
her face as the face of the lifeless. Receiving no answer,
the man questioned within himself: “Is she
dead?” Fear emboldened him, and he essayed active
assistance. Delicately, gently, firmly he raised up the
prostrate woman. She seemed to realize that some
one was assisting her, but she was very passive. Her
head, drooping, rested on the young man’s shoulder,
and she sighed a weary, broken sentence:</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you came, Father Adolphus!”</p>

<p>“Not Father Adolphus, but one rejoiced to serve a
friend of his.”</p>

<p>The maiden was silent a few moments, as if listening
to words coming to her from a distance, through confusions.
Memory was struggling to re-enforce semi-consciousness.
Then came comprehension; she realized
the presence of a stranger, and, with an effort,
stood erect. Her eyes turned on the chaplain’s face
with questionings, having in them mingled surprise,
timidity and rebuke. The man interpreted her glance
and made quick reply:</p>

<p>“At my lady’s services, the Chaplain of the Palestineans.
We are all anxious at the Grand Master’s
concerning yourself.”</p>

<p>“Anxious for me!” She found words to say that
much, and hearing her own words she recalled her
recent thoughts of herself, as one being very miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and very worthless. She turned her eyes from the
young man toward the woodland, in the darkness appearing
like a gateway to black oblivion. She yearned
to bury herself in the oblivion utterly, and her looks
betrayed the thought. The youth gently touched her
arm, saying:</p>

<p>“Despair has no place here; the Palestineans vanquish
it.”</p>

<p>She then looked down toward where she had been
lying, both nerves and will weakening. It seemed to
her a bed, even on the earth, were inviting, especially
so if she could take there a sleep that knew no waking.</p>

<p>The young man had ministered to his fellow-beings
long enough to have become a good interpreter of
hearts. He discerned the thoughts of the one before
him, and offered prompt remedies, words wisely
spoken:</p>

<p>“Our faith makes us all hope to see our guest happy
ere long.”</p>

<p>Then she gave way to a flood of tears. The tears
moved the man to exercise His professional function,
and forgetting all else he spoke as a comforter to a
sorrowing woman. She listened, but, except for her
sobs, was silent until he questioned: “Shall I stay to
guide back to the ‘Refuge,’ or return to send help?”</p>

<p>She answered by turning toward him a face pale and
blank, lighted alone by eyes all appealing. He interpreted
the look and continued: “I’ll tarry to aid.
Shall we now seek the ‘Refuge?’”</p>

<p>Then she exclaimed, “Alas, there seems no refuge
for me!”</p>

<p>“The troubles of Miriamne de Griffin enlist all
hearts at this place, I assure you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>“And this, your kindness, with your happiness ever
before me, but makes to myself my own desolation
more manifest! Ah, I’m but a hulk in a dark tide!”</p>

<p>“Lady, say not so, I beseech you. Look, there!”
Languidly, mechanically, she turned her eyes in the
direction the speaker pointed; then suddenly drew
back from sight of a white apparition, standing out
boldly from a background of dark shrubbery. Her
nerves all unstrung were for the moment victimized by
superstitious dreads.</p>

<p>“Only, calm, pure marble; a fear-slayer; not fear-invoker!
Look at its pedestal!” assuringly spoke
the chaplain. The maiden did as bidden and slowly
read, repeating each word aloud: “<i>Sancta-Maria-Consolatrix-Afflictorum.</i>”</p>

<p>“By easy interpretation: ‘Mother of Jesus, consoler
of the sorrowing!’” responded the young man.</p>

<p>“Ah, like all consolations nigh to me, this is only
stone and set in deep shadows! It can not come to
me!”</p>

<p>“True, yon form is passionless stone; but the truth
eternal, which it emblemizes, is living and fervent.”</p>

<p>“Life and fervor? Death and sorrow submerge
both!”</p>

<p>“There is mother-love in the heart of God; to one so
nearly orphan as my friend, it must be comforting to
look up believing that in heaven there are fatherhood,
motherhood and home! This is the sermon in yon
stone.”</p>

<p>Then the chaplain gently, reverently drew the sorrow
stricken maiden toward the “Refuge” and she followed,
unresisting. As they moved along, she essayed
to seek further acquaintance with her guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I know the chaplain’s name?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; to those that are intimates, ‘Brother’
or ‘Friend;’ for such I’ve renounced my former self
and name.”</p>

<p>“But if I should need and wish to send for you? I
might. I could not call for ‘Brother.’”</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m by right, ‘Cornelius Woelfkin;’ yet the
names are misnomers, since I’m not kin to the wolf,
nor am I ‘a heart-giving light’ as my name implies; at
least if I give light it is but dim.”</p>

<p>The meeting of the young people, apparently accidental,
was in fact an incident in a far-reaching train of
Providences. The young woman was in trouble and
needing such sympathy as one who was both young
and wise could give; the young man was courteous,
pure-minded, wise beyond his years, free from the conceits
common to young men of capacity, and being a
natural philanthropist, naturally sympathetic. The
young woman was at the age that yearns for a girl
friend, and needs a mother’s counsel; the young man
had much of his mother in his make-up; enough to fit him
to win his way into the confidence and fine esteem of
a refined and trusting young woman; but not enough
to make him effeminate. Somehow he exactly met
the needs of Miriamne’s life. He could advise her as
sincerely and wisely as a mother and companion her
as affectionately as a girl friend. Having neither girl
friend nor mother, the young chaplain became both to
her.</p>

<p>They were both impressible and inexperienced in
the matters that belong to the realms of the heart, in
its grander emotions; therefore with a charming simplicity
they outlined their intentions and the limitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
of their relations. They assured each other,
again and again, probably in part to assure themselves,
that they were to be very true and very sensible young
friends. Their converse often ran along after this
manner.</p>

<p>“We understand each other so well!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and are so well adapted to each other!”</p>

<p>“We have had too much experience to spoil this
helpful relation between us, by giving away to any
sway of the romantic emotions.”</p>

<p>“There has seldom been in the world a friendship
between a young man and young woman so exalted
and wise as ours is.”</p>

<p>They agreed that she should call him “brother,” and
he should call her “sister.” At first they said they
wished they were indeed akin by ties of blood;
though in time they were glad they were not. In
this they were like many another pair who have had
such a wish, and in their case as in many another like
it, the wish, was a prediction of its own early demise.</p>

<p>Among the works of art in the park of the Palestineans
was a commanding bronze of Pallas-Athene, the goddess
believed by her pagan devotees to be the patroness
of wisdom, art and science. She was the Virgin of
the Romans and the Greeks, their queenly woman,
deemed by her wisdom ever superior to Mars, god of
war. She was represented bearing both spear and
shield; but these as emblems of her moral potencies.
In a word, she was the result of the efforts of those
ancients to express a perfection that was virgin and
matchless, because too fine and exalted to have an
equal. Between the “White Madonna” and this Minerva,
Chaplain Woelfkin and the Maid of Bozrah often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
walked, back and forth, in very complacent conversations.
They desired themes, the ideals afforded them;
they were in a frame of mind that delighted in Utopianism,
and the effigies of the women guided their day-dreams.
Youth, quickened by dawning, though as yet
unperceived, love, naturally begins building a Pantheon
filled with fine creations. That is the time of hero-worship
in general; afterward comes the iconoclastic
period when every idol is cast down to make place for
the only one that the heart crowns. Cornelius praised
sincerely Miriamne, when she said she would be as the
Græco-Roman goddess—very wise, very pure, very
strong. Day by day, he believed she was becoming
like Minerva. Then he thought it very fine for the
maiden to emulate the goddess in every thing, even her
perpetual virginity. Again, walking near the Madonna
and discoursing of her as the ideal of womanhood,
as the mother, the minister, the saint, the maiden said
she would emulate the latter; the chaplain in his heart
prayed that she might.</p>

<p>Once he finely said: “A pure, patient woman is God’s
appointed and best consoler of the afflicted. Miriamne,
be like Mary, and Sir Charleroy will find restoration.”</p>

<p>The young woman was encouraged by the words to
increase her efforts in her father’s behalf. Now she
did so not only because prompted by a sense of duty,
but because filial love seemed a fine ornament for a
maiden. Birds in mating-times put on their finest
plumage; men and women do likewise. The chaplain
was a humanitarian by profession, and naturally joined
the maiden in her efforts for her father’s recovery. So
their thoughts and their works ran in parallel lines.
They had unbounded delight in their companionship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and common efforts. This delight they innocently
explained to themselves as the natural result and
reward of their fine, exalted, frank, wise, brother-like,
sister-like friendship. In hours of their supremest
satisfaction they generously expressed sorrow
for the world at large, because so few in it knew how
to attain such bliss as they enjoyed. In a word, they
were a very fine and a very innocent pair, a complete
contrast with Rizpah and Sir Charleroy at Gerash.
The latter took their course under the torrid influences
of Astarte of the brawny Giants, the former moved
forward charmed and led by those things that were held
to be the belongings of the fine women whose statues
graced the park of the Palestineans. Miriamne asked
wisdom later of her elect counselor, and he advised
her to send letters to Bozrah urging her mother to join
her in London, in efforts in behalf of their insane kinsman.</p>

<p>The young man very wisely argued: “He is a fragment,
flung out of a wrecked home; his perturbed mind
is clouded by the wild passions of a misled heart.
We must balance his brain by calming his heart. He
is filled with hatings, and love alone is hate’s cure. If
the past losses be recovered, he must be brought back
to the place of loss.”</p>

<p>Miriamne wrote to her mother, glad to please her
counselor by so doing, and yet almost hopeless of gaining
any answer that was favorable. The maiden renewed
her visit to her father’s lodge in the asylum.
She was not permitted, nor did she then desire, to see
her parent. She shuddered when she remembered the
one dreadful meeting of the beginning, and was content
to sit outside the door of his cell or keep, day by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
day, to perform such little services as she could. Sometimes
she would call the insane man by his name, or
title; sometimes she would call out: “Father, would
you like to see Miriamne?” or “Father, your daughter
is here.” At other times she would sit near his door
singing Eastern songs, especially such as she had
heard were favorites of her parents in their younger
days.</p>

<p>Days passed onward, and there appeared no result
beyond the fact that when she was thus engaged the
knight became very quiet. At the suggestion of Chaplain
Woelfkin, she changed her method, and began in
hearing of the knight a recital of the history of Crusader
days. In this she was encouraged, for an attendant
told her that her father each day, when she began, drew
close to his barred door to listen. As she came near
the time of the Acre campaign, the knight’s face was
flushed with interest. Having followed the narrative
up to the fall of the city and the flight of Sir Charleroy
and his comrades, she paused. Then she was surprised
and delighted at once, for the incarcerated man
in a voice both calm and natural, ejaculated the words:
“Go on!”</p>

<p>Miriamne would have rushed to the prison door had
not Cornelius, who stood not far away, motioned her
to remain seated and to continue. For a moment she
was at a loss how to proceed, but then she bethought
herself of an experiment. She described by a kind of
a parable the career of her father, as follows:</p>

<p>“And the noble knight, after years of illness, was
found by his loving daughter. Under her kindly care
he recovered, and at her earnest request he returned to
his home in Palestine. There he spent many happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
years with his reunited family, consisting of a wife,
daughter and twin sons. He is living there now, and
all that family agree that theirs is the most happy and
loving home on earth.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie! a lie!” almost shouted the lunatic.
“Sir Charleroy is not there. He went mad; the devil
stole his skull and left his brain uncovered to be
scratched by a million of bats. That’s why he went
mad; I know him; he went mad, and is mad yet, and
you get away with your lying!”</p>

<p>The daughter fled in terror at the succeeding outburst
of wild profanity; but she was still rejoiced, that a
chord of memory had been struck. It gave a harsh
response, yet it gave a response, and that was much.
She continued her efforts as before. The interviews
were not fruitless, but they were costing her fearfully.
She complained to no one, yet her youthful locks, in a
few months streaked with silver, told the story of
suffering.</p>

<p>One day there was delivered at the Grand Master’s a
huge package directed to herself. Miriamne, filled
with wonder, called help to open the case. Just under
the cover she beheld a letter. She knew the handwriting.
It was her mother’s. Her heart took a great
leap, and as a flash of joy there ran through her mind
the thought:</p>

<p>“Mother has sent something to help. Perhaps it’s
her clothing, and she is coming!”</p>

<p>Tremblingly Miriamne read the epistle. How
formal:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miriamne De Griffin</span>:—Thou went’st without my
leave. Do not return till sent for. Thou left’st a loving
mother for a worthless father, and this is a daughter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
reward. Thou dost say Sir Charleroy is mad. I knew
it, and think that the curse is descending on thee.
But I doubt not the man has cunning in his madness,
and has prompted thee to inveigle me into his toils
again. Once he had me in England, and there he put
me on the rack of his merciless temper and lust!
Shame on him for that time! Shame on me if he have
opportunity to repeat it! I send thee a comforter.
Put it before his eyes, and tell him that the woman of
Bozrah is before him. Tell him that she, like Rizpah
of old, is true to the death to her sons, and, while
waking, never forgets to curse the vultures!”</p>

</div>

<p>No love was added. There was no name appended.
Miriamne felt like one disowned. She dreaded to
examine the contents of the case; but a servant, who
began the opening just then, spread it out. As she
suspected, after she had read the letter, it was the (to
her) hateful picture of ancient Rizpah.</p>

<p>It was evening, and the maiden sought a refuge
from her troubles in the park. It was, on her part,
another flight from the face of Rizpah of Gibeah;
another seeking of solitude from man that she might
gain that sense of nearness to the Eternal Father
under the calm, silent stars of His canopy. It was
like that flight from the old stone house of Bozrah to
the chapel of Father Adolphus that she had made
long before.</p>

<p>The maiden’s course brought her to the “White
Madonna,” and there she found her counselor and
brother, the chaplain. He had heard that Miriamne
was desponding that day, and had bent his course
hither, confident that the “<i>Consolatrix Afflictorum</i>”
would prove a tryst. The scenery around Pallas
Athene was the finer by far, but to a troubled heart
there was the more allurement in the place where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
love of heaven was expressed. The Minerva expressed
self-sufficiency; the “White Madonna,” God’s sufficiency.
One expressed justice, culture, the perfection
of human gifts, regnant and victorious; the other
spoke of welcome, healing, mercy, and help for those
who were in pitiable needs. The virgin evolved by
the philosophers of the Greeks was a concept touching
but few of humanity, and fitted to be crowned only in
a world of perfections, such as has not yet existed.
The “White Madonna” depicted a real character who
had a human heart and heavenly traits, and that easily
found acceptance in human affections.</p>

<p>The maiden and her counselor sat together for a
long time; she speaking of her social miseries, he of
God’s remedies; she describing the thickness of the
night about her; he telling her in beautiful parables
that there was a refuge and an asylum, though the
night obscured all for a time. As they conversed the
rising moon flooded the “White Madonna” with
silvering light, and the chaplain rapturously exclaimed:</p>

<p>“See, the moon gets its light from the sun, and gives
it to the image. We do not see the sun, but we
see its work and glory reflected! So God hands down
from heaven to His children, by His angels and ministers,
the powers and blessings that they need. Miriamne,
we have a Father who forgets none and is
munificent to all!”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Chaplain Woelfkin heard of Miriamne’s
reply from her mother. He was
both glad and sorry thereat; sorry the
heart he tenderly esteemed should have
been so wounded, and glad that the wounding afforded
him opportunity to show how gently and wisely he
could comfort.</p>

<p>“Your trial came at a fortunate time, sister.”</p>

<p>“I can not see how such a rebuke can ever be timely,
being unjust and cruel.”</p>

<p>“True enough; but if fate must assail, it is well to
have its hardships fall on us when we are supported by
dawning hopes. There are hopes near for Miriamne.”</p>

<p>“Let not my brother’s warm heart give me false
comfort. I’ve no sight of hope.”</p>

<p>“Say not so; there is a surprise in store for you.”</p>

<p>“Now, pray, explain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will be permitted to meet your father at the
chapel service to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but—!” and Miriamne bowed her head and
waved her hand as if to repel some unpleasant spectacle.</p>

<p>“Be not perturbed, sister. Let me explain: You
came hither to seek your demented parent, hoping
that love would find a way to compass his healing.
The purpose and effort were alike noble and wise.
You lost heart because the results were slow to appear;
but the good seed was sown, and now for the fruit.”</p>

<p>“Has my father recovered?”</p>

<p>“He has improved, and to-night we’ll sit quietly
while we apply the balm of Gilead.”</p>

<p>“Now am I in a mystery.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne’s ministries have touched a responsive
chord in Sir Charleroy’s heart and fitted him to attend
our mind-cure services. Love is the surest remedy
for a mind gone down under the ruins of the crushed
heart. Sir Charleroy calls his daughter ‘Naaman’s
little maid,’ and but yesterday said: ‘Ah, she’ll take
me to healing Jordan yet!’”</p>

<p>“Blessed be God,” devoutly exclaimed the maiden,
glancing heavenward.</p>

<p>“To which I say ‘amen,’ assured that great things
will come through our ‘<i>Birth of Peace</i>.’”</p>

<p>“And what is that, pray?”</p>

<p>“We are trying to soothe the tumultuous minds of
our asylum patients by displaying sweet peace in
picture garbs. To-night by the aid of a musical and
illustrative service we shall depict, in the chapel, the
Birth of Jesus. But I’ll not explain further now.
Wait until the hour of service, sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>When the people were gathered, Miriamne, glowing
with hope, yet silenced by anxiety, was in the midst
of the assembly. The preliminary services moved
slowly along with a studied absence of hurry. Miriamne
could not give them her attention; she was disappointed
because she did not see her father present, and the
chaplain himself was not there. Presently the music
of the occasion arrested her attention. She followed
its movement and found it gaining control of her feelings.
There was an organ in soft, quiet tones leading
voices that murmured words of trust and rest. She
followed the flowing tide of melody again and again,
each time further, higher, more contentedly, until one
strain, expressive of serene triumph, lifted her to a
very third heaven of satisfaction. There it left her
almost at a loss to say where the melody ceased and
the remembering began.</p>

<p>At that instant, the chaplain passed by her side,
robed in white, hurriedly whispering so she alone
could hear: “Your father is behind the screen of
Templar banners, quietly listening. Be hopeful and
pray. God is good!” The words to her soul were as
rain whisperings to spring flowers in a torrid noon.</p>

<p>Advancing to the raised platform, the young man
told the story of Bethlehem, ending with a beautiful
description of the angel song of “<i>Peace on earth, good
will to men</i>.” The words of the speaker were quietly
spoken, and his address mostly like that of one conversing
with a few friends; but the words were very impressive.
When all had bowed to receive the benediction,
Miriamne, lifting her eyes, beheld her father sitting,
with the flag screen thrown aside, full in view, but
clad as a knight and without manacle or guard. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
a moment he sat thus, then arose and calmly moved
out of the chapel toward his lodge. She obeyed a sudden
impulse and rose to speed after him, but the restraining
hand of the Grand Master was laid on her arm:</p>

<p>“Wait; not yet, daughter.”</p>

<p>Renewed hope made it easy for her to comply, and
she sat down again filled with gratitude toward God.
A series of similar services followed, each bringing new
causes for hopefulness to the maiden.</p>

<p>“We are going to Cana to-day, sister,” remarked
the young chaplain some weeks subsequent to the
“Birth of Peace” service.</p>

<p>“To Cana?”</p>

<p>“To Cana, and for a purpose.”</p>

<p>“I can not fathom it, brother.”</p>

<p>Then the young man explained to his fair hearer the
scripture event, and the method devised for presenting
it at the chapel, as intended that day.</p>

<p>The patients and their friends were assembled in the
chapel again. Sir Charleroy among them, but silent
and absorbed with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>“We are going to try a device to gain his attention,”
whispered the chaplain to Miriamne. Just then the
Grand Master, dressed in the full regalia of a knight,
ascended the platform and uncovered to view a huge
earthen vessel, remarking: “Friends, we want to
exhibit this evening a vessel, on its way now to
France, but left for a time in our custody by some of
our comrade Crusaders, who brought it from Cana in
Galilee.”</p>

<p>“Knights,” “Crusaders,” “Cana!” murmured Sir
Charleroy, as if in soliloquy. Miriamne observed her
father’s eyes. They were no longer leaden; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
glowed with interest. “You all remember,” continued
the Grand Master, “how Jesus turned the water into
wine at Cana? Tradition informs us that this before
us is one of the identical water-pots used that time by
our Savior; but I’ll leave our chaplain to tell the rest.”
The youth took his position at the pulpit and began
informally to talk, as if in conversation, but he had
anxiously, carefully prepared for the occasion.</p>

<p>He first pictured Cana, with its limestone houses,
sitting on the side of the highlands, a few miles north-east
of Nazareth. “This place,” he continued, “is the
reminder of two instructive events. I have their history
here.” Thereupon, Cornelius turned to an illuminated
volume and began reading, with passing comments.
As he read, Sir Charleroy closely watched the
reader; the puzzled look of the listener faded into satisfied
attention.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Jesus was proclaimed the Lamb of God, near Cana, by
that vehement, self-starving Baptist John. But in habits
and manner of living John and Jesus were utterly dissimilar.
There was harmony in the great things, faith and charity
in all things.”</p>

</div>

<p>The mad knight nodded inquiringly.</p>

<p>The student continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Jesus, the organizer of the new kingdom, at Cana,
unfolded one part of His policy, for nigh here twain questioned:
‘<i>Where dwellest thou?</i>’ Jesus instantly invited
them to His own abode. They dwelt with Him a day,
and were won to be His loyal disciples, thus attesting
the power of Christ in the home. And they got a home
religion, for one of these, Andrew, at once sought to win
his brother Peter to discipleship. On the eve of Cana’s
wedding feast Jesus won Philip, saying, ‘<i>Follow me</i>,’ and
Philip hasted to win Nathaniel, crying, ‘Come and see.’
To these He spoke of a hereafter home with open doors and
a holy family. Each of Jesus’s true disciples was impelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
to haste and tell salvation’s story to his nearest kin. Christianity
is a feast beginning in the home circle and spreading
to all the earth.”</p>

</div>

<p>The mad knight, as he listened, cast a glance of inquiry
over his shoulder at those near him.</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy applies the lesson to himself,” whispered
the Grand Master to Miriamne.</p>

<p>Cornelius went on:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cana was the home of Nathaniel. We see this poor
man sitting in seclusion under a fig tree. Except his
doubts, he was alone. To him Jesus went, and at the door
of his own home the Master met him. Because Nathaniel
believed, on little evidence, God gave him more, and promised
him that he should see heaven open and the angels
ascending and descending, as in Jacob’s vision. So are
those winged messengers passing back and forth forever, to
minister to and comfort needy man. One may be lost to
the world, to friends, to himself, but never lost to the Good
Shepherd, who is like the one in the parable leaving the
ninety and nine to follow the lamb that was straying.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Charleroy’s head bowed, and Miriamne was glad,
for she saw the tears falling thick and fast down his
pallid cheeks.</p>

<p>A sign from the attending physicians brought the
services quietly to a close. They had seen the emotion
of the knight, and desired that the feelings aroused
be permitted to quietly ebb.</p>

<p>A few days later, by their advice, the Grand Master
summoned the chaplain of the Palestineans to hold another
service like the last. “Sir Charleroy was blessed
that last day. He evinces interest and natural reasonings.
Since the former service he has repeated the
story of Cana over and over, together with the substance
of thy discourse thereon. Besides that, he
never tires of inquiring about the ‘ruddy priest of the
sweet words,’” said the physician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>“I obey, my Master, it’s God’s will. What shall be
my theme?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cana continued; De Griffin is constantly inquiring
as to when the ruddy priest of the sweet words
is to continue the tale of the Cana,” said the Grand
Master.</p>

<p>“Praise the Day Spring that hath visited us!”</p>

<p>“You echo the thought of all our souls, Cornelius.”</p>

<p>And it was so that on the day following the chapel
of the “House of Rest” was filled with much the same
company that met there the last time.</p>

<p>Miriamne arrived early and eagerly questioned
Cornelius as he passed her on his way to his robing-room:</p>

<p>“Oh, brother, hast thou a message of grace and
hope for me, to-day?”</p>

<p>“<i>The entrance of thy word giveth light</i>,” was his
quiet reply; and he passed on, not daring to tarry near
the woman that so strangely moved him. He felt
very serious, and hence avoided that which might distract
his attention.</p>

<p>But Miriamne felt assured, while Cornelius was all
faith in the efficacy of the Divine word in working the
cure of minds perturbed.</p>

<p>Presently he stood behind his reading-desk and,
waiting until the organ tone had died away, commenced
by reading these words:</p>

<p>“And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of
Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</p>

<p>“And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to
the marriage.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy had entered the chapel, and was moving
toward a lonely seat; his motions were languid;
his action listless, except when at intervals he gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
into the empty air and hissed some incoherent words
at imaginary people. But the word “Cana” arrested
his attention. He looked up, smiled, and then exclaimed:
“Oh, the red-faced! That’s it; tell us more,
more of Cana!”</p>

<p>Cornelius complied. “We have here a story of two
lives in the most precious tie on earth, marriage.”</p>

<p>Then the chaplain read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We see Christ at a Jewish wedding, and the Hebrew
marriage was ever an occasion of great joy. Not only so,
but the weddings of that people were characterized by very
instructive and impressive ceremonies. Let me explain.
The day before the wedding both bride and groom fasted,
confessed their sins and made ceremonial atonement for the
errors of their past lives. They were to be part of each
other, and felt that each owed it to the other to be free
from burden or taint of the past. Both bride and groom at
the wedding wore wreaths of myrtle, the emblem of justice,
constantly to typify that virtue as supreme in wedlock.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Oh, young priest, thou art an angel!”</p>

<p>The voice startled all but Sir Charleroy. He had
spoken, yet his face indicated only placidity and interest.
Cornelius proceeded:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The bride, veiled from head to foot to show that her
beauty was to be seen only by him to whom she gave herself,
decked with a girdle, emblem of strength and subjection,
was led in triumph from the home of her father to the
home of him who was to possess her. Before she took her
departure, kindly hands anointed her with sweet perfumes
and gave her priceless jewels; while on her way she was
met by all her friends, singing songs and bearing torches to
gladden her journey toward her new abode. Thus they that
loved the bride did bestir themselves to bestow bounties and
make the maiden most choice. There was no detraction,
no defiling, no effort to belittle. Were wives aided like
brides there would be fewer broken hearts among wedded
women.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wondrous true, ruddy priest!” It was the mad
knight’s voice. Cornelius continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The feast of the wedding lasted seven days. To such
a gathering Jesus once went. Probably this was the marriage
of a kinsman. Thus, immediately after His temptation and
His baptism, with His mighty redemptional work all before
Him, our Lord deemed it a leading duty to give proper attention
to this wedding ceremonial, one of the lesser things
that make up so much of life. With man supreme selfishness,
or natural littleness, engenders apathy to all except
some pre-occupying purpose, but He, in whom all fullness
dwells, entered into and embraced around about all life.
He was as glorious when meddling with human joys and
making the waters of Cana blush to wine, as when grappling
with the sorrows of sin and setting Himself up on Calvary
the beacon and light of the ages.”</p>

</div>

<p>Miriamne felt the illumination again that first came
to her that Easter-day at Bozrah, while Sir Charleroy’s
face glowed with intelligence and peace. This was a
full, round gospel which Cornelius was proclaiming, and
every soul present was fed.</p>

<p>After pausing for an interlude of soothing music he
again proceeded with his discoursing as one conversing:</p>

<p>“At Cana, Christ bound as a captive, natural law.
How He did so we do not know, but we do know that
while destroying no part of nature’s system he mysteriously
made it serve for human happiness in a way
unusual and marvelous. It seems to me that the story
of Cana is a fireside story. No matter how miserable
a home may be, it may have faith that in welcoming
the Divine guest it welcomes assured miraculous joy.
Life’s waters may blush everywhere to heaven’s wine!”</p>

<p>The mad knight murmured: “Oh, ruddy priest! if
thou couldst only preach this in Bozrah.”</p>

<p>The Grand Master, who was sitting by Miriamne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
pressed her hand and whispered: “Memory is reviving—praise
to the Day-Spring!”</p>

<p>Cornelius again read his parchment.</p>

<p>“And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus
saith unto him, They have no wine.</p>

<p>“Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do
with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.”</p>

<p>“So,” said the reader, “these folks were likely poor,
the supply meager, though no man ever yet had enough
of the wine of joy at his wedding until it was blessed
by the God of marriage.”</p>

<p>Just then Sir Charleroy, standing up, solemnly said:
“Young man, I’d have thee tell these people why He
said ‘Woman, what have I to do with thee?’ He, the
man, was master, that was it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, motion to Cornelius not to debate,” whispered
Miriamne to the Grand Master; but Cornelius was already
adroitly replying:</p>

<p>“True, knight of Saint Mary, but this Master of
ceremonies was Divine. Then He was not talking to
his wife. He had not wed this woman, hence was not
bound by the law of being her other self. Besides that
we must not forget that they had often conversed intimately
before the wedding; she with all the tenderness
of a woman’s heart, which in its love ever naturally
outruns all plans, all reasonings, to bestow all it
has at once upon the all-beloved. She hurried Christ
in the way of giving. This to her credit, if her wisdom
is reproved.”</p>

<p>The knight settled back in his seat, his face very
pale but not anger-marked.</p>

<p>Cornelius continued: “The term ‘woman’ is often
used, as here, in all tenderness. Our rugged language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
ill translates the original. When a people has not fine
moods in its living, its language becomes like sackcloth,
unfit to clothe the angel-like thoughts of those
who live on more exalted planes. The gross degrade
all their companions, whether such be beings or merely
words.”</p>

<p>The leader again read:</p>

<p>“His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever
he saith unto you, do it.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This shows the good, motherly Mary supplementing
the Master’s work. Doubtless, she had her partisans, some
who would have sided with her had she chosen to rebuke
her Son. But she desired harmony at the feast and in the
home. This was the chief end, and for it she was willing
to serve and wait.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Very true! Our Lady was always right and good.”
It was the voice of the mad knight.</p>

<p>Cornelius continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These were the finest words Mary ever spoke; they
were the key to her whole life; indeed, the spirit of the
ideal woman ever more standing nearer to Christ than any
other being; at a wedding, the very climax of fullest human
love, the gateway to home, the counterpart of heaven, Mary
points all to the Christ, exclaiming, ‘<i>Hear ye Him!</i>’”</p>

</div>

<p>“Our Lady was always a wise, brave, loving, submissive
woman,” exclaimed Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“It is an old tradition,” replied Cornelius, “that
this was the wedding of John, the beloved and confidant
of Jesus. It is interesting to remember that that
blessed disciple, in his Gospel, presents the one whom
he loved as a mother but twice—once at this wedding,
the other time at the crucifixion; the places of highest
joy, and deepest sorrow; a way of saying from the altar
to the cross, is woman’s course; a parable-like presentment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of the doctrine that the wife and mother are to
appear at these two points, so opposite, so common to
all; the lowest dip, the highest heaven.”</p>

<p>The mad knight suddenly interrupted them.</p>

<p>“What did Joseph think of all this?”</p>

<p>Perhaps this odd query was fortunate, for it brought
smiles to all. The knight laughed out until his eyes
were flowing with tears.</p>

<p>Cornelius, self-possessed, quietly replied: “It is said
that Joseph was dead long ere this wedding, and that
Mary was exhaling the perfumes of her consecrated
widowed life to gladdening in pious ministries the people
about her. Widowhood has such purposes.”</p>

<p>“Ah, she was the Rose,” cried the knight. “If
Joseph were not dead, he might well stand back, behind
such a wife!”</p>

<p>The chaplain of the Palestineans closed with a well-worded
climax, recalling the fact that this event made
a lasting impression on the Son of God, as evinced by
the wondrous tropes of the Apocalypse, where eternal
goodness and eternal joy are pictured under the similitude
of a wedding-feast.</p>

<p>The mad knight cried out: “Grand, grand! Oh,
ruddy priest, I worship thee!”</p>

<p>The Grand Master signaled the conclusion. The
worshipers and patients were slowly retiring, Sir
Charleroy moving toward his lodge seemingly wrapped
in contemplation of some engrossing problem.</p>

<p>He passed near the picture of “Rizpah Defending
Her Relatives,” which by some mischance had been
left near the chapel door. Instantly the knight’s attention
was fixed; he became excited, then suddenly
turning to an attendant, exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, tell me, where am I? Is this London or
Bozrah?”</p>

<p>“London, good Teuton.”</p>

<p>Again he gazed at the picture, and his transformation
was startling. His face was distorted, his body
became rigid and swayed as that of the hooded snake
making ready to strike a victim. Then bounding to
the Grand Master’s side he snatched the latter’s sword
from its hilt, quickly returned to the picture, and before
any could prevent him began to hack it to pieces.</p>

<p>One tried to restrain him, but was overpowered, two,
then three were flung aside. Presently he was pinioned
but not silenced.</p>

<p>“Away! Unhand me!” he shouted. “In the name
of the King of Jerusalem, the defenders of the Sepulcher,
unhand me! Do you not see? There! they’ve
come to make riot at the feast of Cana! Ruddy priest,
come quickly. Help! This fearful gang will all be
loose in a moment; they be the ghosts of the giants,
and war everlastingly against the peace of homes;
against our Mary and her Son’s kingdom.”</p>

<p>He was breathless for a moment, and all were anxious
lest he be permanently unsettled. Some were
praying for him, others holding him. Then he broke
forth again as before.</p>

<p>“Unhand me, infidels! God wills it! Let me cut to
pieces yon horrible thing fresh from hot hell; painted
by the gory and beslimed hands of devils! See! it’s
bewitched, and the woman and the hanging men and
the vultures are all alive! They’ll be at us! One of
those black birds has feasted on my heart for years,
and yon woman has nightly beaten my bare brain with
her club.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>They tried to calm him; his daughter pressed to his
side, and flinging her arms about the knight, beseechingly
cried: “Father! father! it is I! Miriamne!”</p>

<p>“Miriamne? Ha! ha!” cried the excited man.
“More mockery! More witchery! Miriamne is lost,
eternally lost! Yon group of demons tore her from
me! Oh, God, if thou lovest a soldier of the cross,
hear me, and blast with burning, swift and quenchless
lightnings, yon monsters, and with them all who separate
hearts and wreck homes!”</p>

<p>“Father, so say we all; let us pray together,”
pleaded the girl.</p>

<p>“Father! Who says ‘father’ to me?”</p>

<p>“It is I, your daughter, Miriamne!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, Sir Charleroy became calm and curiously
observed the maiden. “Art thou Sir Charleroy’s
daughter? I knew him once in Palestine. He died
afterward in London and left me his body. But it’s
not much use. It’s sick most of the time. I carry it
about, though, hoping he’ll come for it. If thou dost
want it thou canst have it.”</p>

<p>The daughter humored the fancy, and quickly
replied: “I do want it. I love it. I’ll help you take
care of it. Let me now hug it to my heart.”</p>

<p>Then he permitted her to twine about him her arms,
and when she kissed him the second time he returned
the salutation, and tears ran down his hot cheeks.</p>

<p>“Blessed be the God of peace,” fervently ejaculated
Cornelius. “The day dawns; after tears, light.”</p>

<p>The knight continued after a time, addressing Miriamne:</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy was my friend; and thou art his
daughter? Thou wouldst not deceive me, I know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Tell me in a few words,” he said, meanwhile furtively
glancing about, “Who am I?”</p>

<p>Miriamne again humored him, and pressing her lips
nigh his ear, in a whisper replied: “Sir Charleroy,
Teutonic knight, my father.”</p>

<p>The old man held her off a little way, gazed at her
a moment, doubtfully, then said: “Thou art large for
a baby! Miriamne is a little thing.” Then he continued:
“But thy eyes, they are Miriamne’s; and so
honest! I believe them! Then thou art Miriamne
and I Sir Charleroy?”</p>

<p>“Truly.” And again she kissed her father.</p>

<p>“But thou dost not want me—a wreck, a pauper!”</p>

<p>“I do, and the boys do; all Bozrah wants you, needs
you.”</p>

<p>“Not thy mother! Oh, no; I murdered her long
ago!”</p>

<p>“Not so, dear father.”</p>

<p>“I did, indeed. See,” and he pointed to the painting,
“I’ve killed her again, to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s but a miserable painting, and I hate it as
much as you do; but it’s harmless, henceforth.”</p>

<p>“Are all the devils in it dead; the vultures that ate
up my heart?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; who cares for them?”</p>

<p>“Then I shall get better.”</p>

<p>The mad knight suffered himself to be led away
quietly. There was great joy among the Palestineans
that night. And so Miriamne carried the spirit of
Mary, that presided at Cana’s feast, into the misery of
that English asylum. She had given her life to ministering
for others, had begun in her own home circle,
her life motto: “<i>Hear ye Him</i>”—“<i>Whatsoever He saith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
unto you, do it.</i>” Now she was rewarded, and began to
hope that there would be the renewal of wedding
chimes at Bozrah, that the wine of its joy would be
renewed and sweetened. She questioned the chaplain
for advice. “Tell the Master there is no wine in the
old stone house, and ‘<i>whatsoever He saith, do it</i>,’” was
the young man’s answer.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Like the morning dawn on a calm sea, after
a night of fierce storm, so came now great
peace to Miriamne. The heaviest sorrow
of her life was lifting. Her father was recovering;
his mind becoming rational; and chief of
Miriamne’s joys, was the fact that his convalescence
was accompanied by the appearance of a deep trusting
love for herself. He seemed to lean on his daughter
for help; cling to her for hope and aim, by every way,
not only to express his sense of dependence on but his
deep and abiding gratitude toward the patient, chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
minister, in the mission of his recovery. He seemed
for a long time to be haunted by a fear of relapse into
some great misery that he but dimly remembered
and could not define, beyond a shudder. He dreaded
to be alone, and often clung to his daughter with furtive
glances of fear, even as a terrified child clings to
its mother. One day, months after he had begun to
be rational, he addressed Miriamne: “We must soon
seek another abiding place, daughter. Our Grand
Master has discharged with overflowing payment,
every debt of hospitality.”</p>

<p>“True, father, and I’m glad; the thought for weeks
in my mind, is now in yours. But where shall we
go?”</p>

<p>“I think, to France, and immediately.”</p>

<p>“France?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there I’ll seek out some of the De Griffins.
They may be able to mend my shattered fortunes, and
if I find none of my kin, I shall not be lacking in any
thing, for there are many of our Teutonic knights.
While they prosper, no want shall harass me or mine.”</p>

<p>“Father, I do not want to go to France.”</p>

<p>“Why, this is strange?”</p>

<p>“It seems far away, very far, to me.”</p>

<p>“Art thou dreaming, my Syrian Oriole?”</p>

<p>“No, awake! And very earnest.”</p>

<p>“Why, we could walk thither, were it not for the water.”</p>

<p>“But I can not go that way!”</p>

<p>“Well, we can not stay here, so where?”</p>

<p>“Eastward; Bozrah!”</p>

<p>“Wouldst thou ask a spirit, by mercy permitted escape
from Tophet to return?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, even that, if the spirit had a mission and a
safe conduct.”</p>

<p>“Thou art nobler, braver than I. I can’t trust the
land of giants and vultures.”</p>

<p>“The giants and vultures we must meet are in human
forms, and such are everywhere.”</p>

<p>“There are over many for the population, in Syria
and beyond it.”</p>

<p>“But there have been many changes since you left
that country, especially, in our city,” persisted the
maiden.</p>

<p>“Nothing changes in Palestine or Bozrah, daughter,
except wives, and they only one way; from bad to
worse.”</p>

<p>The young chaplain seconded Miriamne’s efforts.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy was spasmodically the stronger, but
Miriamne by patience and persistence prevailed. In
time, she won her cause, and the three took sail for
the Holy Land, the knight protesting that he would
go as far as Acre and no further. The journey was
slow but not monotonous, for the English trader on
which they journeyed stopped at various ports. Cornelius
on his part was enjoying a serene delight that
had no shadow except when he remembered that voyaging
with Miriamne was to have an end; Miriamne on
her part had three-fold pleasure; delight in her companionship
with the young missionary, delight in the
continued improvement of her father’s health, and
greater delight still in the glowing hope of the success
of her mission of peace to her home-circle. As for Sir
Charleroy it suited him well to be sailing. He was
ever exhilarated by change; each day brought it. He
was in theory a fatalist, and the staunch ship pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
onward day and night to its destination, carrying all
along, was an expression of the inexorable. Then the
conditions about him rested him, for he was freed from
any need of bracing of his will to choose or execute
any thing. He went forward because the ship went.
That was all and enough. Only once during the voyage
did he assert himself or express a desire to change
his course. <span class="smcap">That was when passing Cyprus.</span></p>

<p>“Here,” he cried, “let me disembark!”</p>

<p>Persuasively, Miriamne protested.</p>

<p>“But I must! I’ve a mission. I want to curse the
memory of the recreant Lusignan, the coward ‘King of
Jerusalem;’ he that clandestinely stole away from
Acre on the eve of those last days!”</p>

<p>“But, father, Cyprus is called the ‘horned island.’
I do not like the name!”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard it better named, ‘the blessed isle.’
There the hospitable knights had a refuge for pilgrims,
and it still abides.”</p>

<p>Just then some of the sailors cried, “Olympus!”
They had caught sight of that ancient mountain, the
fabled home of the gods.</p>

<p>Miriamne adroitly used the cry to divert her father’s
mind, saying:</p>

<p>“Let those admire Olympus who will; as for me, I
prefer holy, fragrant Lebanon.”</p>

<p>She pointed eastward, and they saw the dim outlines
of Palestine’s famous range. The knight’s attention
was fixed on Lebanon, and they sailed past Cyprus
quietly without further objection on his part.</p>

<p>Miriamne and Cornelius, as the night began to settle
down, stood together by the ship’s side, feasting on
glimpses of the distant shore. There were signs of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
coming storm, perceived intuitively by those accustomed
to the sea, by the young watchers best discerned
in the anxious looks of the seamen.</p>

<p>“The captain says the sky and sea are preparing for
a duel. You noticed how the blue changed to dark
brown in the water this afternoon? He says that, and
the muddy appearance of the sky, betoken a tempest.”</p>

<p>“How like polished silver the wings of those gulls
glisten as they career!” was the maiden’s ecstatic reply.</p>

<p>“The wings are as they always are. They glisten
now because they flash against a murky background.”</p>

<p>“An omen, Cornelius, for good! I’ll call the sea-birds
hope’s carrier-pigeons with messages for us.”</p>

<p>“I would we had their wondrous power of outriding
all storms. It is said they can sleep on the waves,
even during a tempest.”</p>

<p>“I’ve the heart of a sea-gull, to-night.”</p>

<p>“And not a dread or pang within?”</p>

<p>“No, no! Oh, come, any power, to hurry us to
Acre! I’d give way to the merriment of the becalmed
sailors, who whistle for the wind, if I only knew the
notes of their call.”</p>

<p>“But the old sea-captain is very grave. See how the
men at his command are lashing up almost every stitch
of our ship’s dress.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ll be grave, too, to please you; and yet
I pray that Old Boreas, and all the Boreadal, come in
racing hurricanes, if need be, that we may be sent gallantly
into longed-for Acre!”</p>

<p>“A storm at sea is grand in a picture or in imagination;
sometimes, though rarely, in experience. To be
enjoyed it must be terrible; there’s the rub; it may
come with overmastering fury.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bird of ill omen! Why cry as in requiems? As
for me, while you are fearing going down, I’ll be thinking
of going forward!”</p>

<p>“And be disappointed, certainly, on your part, as I
hope I may be mistaken on mine. We may not go
down; we shall certainly not go forward!”</p>

<p>“Now, how like a wayward man! Since you can
not have your way, cross me by predicting my frustration!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not lay the blame on me! there are broader
shoulders to bear it. Lay the blame on the Taurus
and Lebanon ranges!”</p>

<p>“Well, this is an odd saying, surely!”</p>

<p>“Wait awhile, and you will find it very true, as well.
We are to meet to-night, most likely, the Levanter or
off-shore gale, Paul’s Euroclydon, charging down from
its mountain castles. Taurus and Lebanon together
form a cave of the winds!”</p>

<p>“And you seem glad that they are coming to battle
us back?” spake the maiden, rebukingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, if they prolong our companionship. I can not
rejoice in a speed that hastens our parting.”</p>

<p>The last sentence died on the chaplain’s paling lips
with a sigh.</p>

<p>The maiden turned her eyes full on the speaker,
then slowly, meditatively answered:</p>

<p>“I shall be sorry, too, at our parting!”</p>

<p>“‘Sorry!’ Ah! that’s no word for me, this time;
agonized is better!” was the young missioner’s quick
rejoinder.</p>

<p>The maiden was pained, but she mastered her feelings
and pleaded:</p>

<p>“The parting must come some time; do not let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
such repinings make it harder for both. It is wiser,
when confronting what one does not desire, but can not
help, to court the balm of forgetfulness. So do I ever,
especially now.”</p>

<p>“And like all attempted silencings of the heart,
by cold philosophy, mocked at last by failure!”</p>

<p>“My philosophy can not mock me, since it accords
with the stern facts which confront us. I’ll be as
frank now as a sister, Cornelius. Our diverging missions
part us. You go to Jerusalem to preach the
cross; I, to a narrower field, at Bozrah, to attempt the
rekindling of love on one lone altar of wedlock. God
orders it thus, and I submit unquestioningly; for it is
not for one who can scarcely touch the hem of His
garment to challenge His wisdom by a murmur.”</p>

<p>“But time, Miriamne, may leave you free, your
work being completed in the Giant City?”</p>

<p>“Even so. There is a gulf between us; we may
love across it but not pass it, in body, in this life.”</p>

<p>“And I can not see the gulf?”</p>

<p>“I am in faith, after all, an Israelite; enlightened to
be sure, but not likely to renounce the ancient beliefs.
You are a Christian; nor would I wish you otherwise.
Now, amid the miseries I’ve witnessed in my own
home, I can not but be admonished against any attempt
at fusing, by the fire of adolescent, transitory
loving, two lives guided by faiths so constantly in antagonisms.”</p>

<p>“The faith of Jesus and Mary, truly lived, never
failed to fuse hearts sincerely loving. You may call
yourself what you like; in substance of faith we are in
accord.”</p>

<p>“The chaplain reasons well; better than I can, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
yet he does not convince me! I can only plead that
he do not persist, and so make the parting harder. It
must be; though my heart break, I must suffer the
immolation. I’ve asked this question in the awful
sincerity of a soul as it were at the bar of judgment:
‘<i>What wilt Thou have me to do?</i>’ I know the answer.
I must seek to bring father and mother together.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Seek to know if the Messiah has indeed come.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“If I find He has, some way tell His people Israel,
as only a Jewess can, of the Light Everlasting.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s sufficient to measure the lives of generations;
but if I survive beyond that work, I have
vaguely passing through my mind the coming of a
millennial day when all mankind will be akin; all righteous,
all just, and the tears of womankind assuaged.”</p>

<p>“I pray for that, but how can we hasten joy by
breaking our own hearts?”</p>

<p>“I do not know what lies beyond; how that day of
glory is to come, but this I know, the spirit of Chivalry
was from God. It had, and has a deep, impressive meaning.
In contact with it at the west, I felt all the time
as if it were blind, but a Samson still, feeling for the
pillars of some mighty wrong. I wonder if I may not
be the giant’s true guide. Or, better still, may I not
be, under God, the giantess to do the very work. Perhaps
the world awaits a woman Samson!”</p>

<p>“What Miriamne says is to me all mysticism!
Explain.”</p>

<p>“I do not know how, beyond this: I’m God’s bride
by consecration, and He will keep me for His work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t I share it?” almost piteously, the chaplain
asked.</p>

<p>“Truly, yes, wherever you may be, with me or not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miriamne, your passionate enthusiasm entrances
me. You are an inspiration to me. I fear I
shall languish aside from you.”</p>

<p>“I shall love you more, Cornelius, as you are more
grandly, heroically self-sacrificing.”</p>

<p>“Any thing to win Miriamne’s constant love!”</p>

<p>“I shall love you, Cornelius, in a deep, holy way,
only and forever. I’d be ashamed to be thus frank,
but that I have a love that is as pure as the heaven of
its birth. Be true to your God, to your mission; a
little while and then at the City of Light, life’s brief
dream over, the first, after God, I’ll ask for will be the
faithful man whom my heart knows.”</p>

<p>“Ah, what can I do? I’m all zeal; willing to go, but
the glow of your cheeks, the flash of your eyes, even
in the midst of such noble converse, drag me away
from my resolves. That that stimulates me, unmans
me, or reminds me I am a man and a lover.”</p>

<p>“You ought to teach me, not I you; but you remember
you told me of the belief of some in ‘penetrative
virginity.’ That is the purity of Mary passing
somehow into others. Oh, all I am that’s good, be in
you, and more, even all that she was whom you so
revere; I mean the mother of the Christ.”</p>

<p>“In my soul I reverently exclaim ‘amen,’ but then
again, how strange the question will not down, ‘must
we part?’” And so saying he flung his arm about the
woman, passionately embracing her. He thought for
a moment he had overcome her, but the kiss on her
lips not resisted, was the end; for slowly untwining his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
arms and holding his hands at arm’s length, she questioned:
“Will you promise me one thing?”</p>

<p>“Surely, yes, name it.”</p>

<p>“That you will think of me as a friend, sister, henceforth,
and let me go my way without further misery?”</p>

<p>The man struggled with himself for a time; then
gazed into her eyes with a most piteously appealing
gaze.</p>

<p>She was firm.</p>

<p>“Yes—I promise, but say affianced, to be wed in
heaven?”</p>

<p>“God bless you,” was her instant response. Their
lips met and the debate was ended.</p>

<p>And so for the time they separated, persuading
themselves that the whole matter between them had
been finally sealed. They had all faith in their pledges
mutually given, each to live apart from the other. As
yet they had no just conception of the power of a
rebel heart constantly uprising. Of course, they both
foresaw a measure of wretchedness in the future as a
consequence of their decision, but distant pain foreseen
by the young, is ever dimmed by hope, and very
different from present pain. These twain comforted
themselves, at first, by the thought that they were martyrs,
and it is always agreeable to feel ourself a martyr,
especially when expecting a martyr’s reward; at least
it is so until the reality of the martyrdom comes.</p>

<p>The sky grew darker, night shut down about the
ship, the winds increased, and that sense of awful loneliness,
felt on the eve of an impending night-storm at
sea, came to all hearts but those of the sailors. The
latter were too busy to think of aught but their duties.
Then their captain had his reckonings, and assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
them by his bearing that he felt confident that he
could outride this storm as he had often before similar
ones. Miriamne, yielding not more to the captain’s
command, than to the entreaties of Woelfkin, went
below to her cabin. She soon courted sleep to help
her forget the war of the tempest, praying a prayer
most fitting, meanwhile. The prayer was a meditation,
like unto this: “He that cares for all will care
for helpless me, and come what may, keep me until
that last great day.” The storm strengthened, and she
began to be anxious for her father, and her friend. She
had said to herself the latter title should define Cornelius.
But her heart forgot its fear a moment in a
mysterious, merry peal of laughter; such laughter is
very real, but it is never heard by human ears. We
know it only in those exalted moments when we try
fine introspections; when there seems to be two of us;
the one observing and entering into the other. Miriamne
heard that laughter when she meditated, “Cornelius
is just a friend.” Presently she became more
anxious for those aloft. Then a troop of imperious
inner questions came to her: “Might I not stand by
him, if the danger increases? Would it be wrong to
show him that I am brave and loving?”</p>

<p>“Will he think me cowardly and stony-hearted?”
Resolution was being assailed, and weakened. The
questionings increased in number and imperiousness:
“What if to-night we are all to perish?” Then she
let imagination take the rein. She thought of a scene
that might be if she and her beloved were as betrothed,
soon to be wed, lovers. In the scene she fancied
herself, her lover and her father all together in a
last embrace, going down into the yawning waves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
“Would my lover try to save me?” For the moment
there were two of her again, and it was the one that
awhile ago laughed so merrily, that now seemed to be
saying: “Would my lover try to save me?” The one
self heard the question, and by silence, without sign of
rebuke, seemed to give the other self plenary indulgence.
Then came a free play of her imagination.
She saw herself lying in coral palaces, beneath the
moaning waves of the Mediterranean, still clasping
her lover and her parent. Then she thought of how
her friends would receive the news of her demise.
Perhaps some poet would embalm the event in deathless
poems, and thousands read of the three that perished
side by side. Her mind ran back to London.
She imagined a memorial service at the chapel of the
Palestineans and the Grand Master there saying: “Miriamne
de Griffin was lost at sea; in the path of glorious
duty, loyally pursued to the end.”</p>

<p>Then she thought of Bozrah and the old stone house,
with her mother and her brothers, its sole occupants;
the mother in mourning garbs, her spirit subdued, and
she often tenderly saying to the fatherless, sisterless
boys, “Miriamne was a good girl, a faithful daughter,
a noble woman.”</p>

<p>But after all, these excursions were unsatisfactory to
the young woman. And naturally so. When she
thought of lying a corpse, with weed-winding sheets,
for years, in the caves of the sea, she was repelled.
Thoughts of her memorials, possibly to transpire at
London and Bozrah, were not very comforting. She
was too young, too free from morbidness, too deeply
enamored, to court, assiduously, posthumous honors.</p>

<p>Then came thought of a wreck and rescue, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
was very welcome. It grew out of the possibility of
the youth she loved and she alone, of all on board,
being saved. She thought of drifting about for days
on a raft! Would she recall her resolutions and his, or
would he say to her: “Miriamne, I saved you from the
deep; now you are mine entirely and forever!”
Would she believe his claim paramount? Would
duty’s requirements be satisfied? Then she was as
two again. One voice said ‘yes,’ and the other did not
concur, neither did it gainsay. She could not pronounce
a verdict and there were tears flowing.</p>

<p>The storm grew stronger, but the laboring ship rose
and fell on the billows at intervals, and she was lulled
to sleep. Her last thoughts, as she passed into dreamland,
were that it would have been a useless pain, both
endured, if now they were to be lost; the pain of determining,
as they had, to live apart. As she so
thought she wished almost that they had not resolved
as they had. Conscience and desire were in their
ceaseless warfare. Then sleeping brought a dream of
joy, the blessing that comes often to the heart that is
clean. The dream was colored by events preceding.</p>

<p>Cornelius had reminded her the day before, as they
were sailing along the coast of Cyprus, that, at
Paphos, on that island, there was once a temple to
Venus, the fabled goddess of love. That divinity, surrounded
by multitudes paying her homage, came before
the dreamer’s mind in all those ravishing splendors
of person that are so attractive to human desires.
Around the goddess, and very close to her, were hosts
of young men and maidens, their actions as boisterous
and ecstatic as those intoxicated. Outside of the
throngs of youths were others older: and outside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
these were others still; those far away from the goddess,
seemingly bowed with years. The company of
youths was constantly increased by new arrivals who
crowded back those there before them.</p>

<p>But there was a depletion as well as augmenting of
the vast, surging congregation; for anon, as if mad,
some nearest the deity rushed away, both of the men
and the maidens, nor did those fleeing stop until they
found violent deaths by leaping from cliffs or into the
sea.</p>

<p>Then the ancients, crowded continually back by the
new arrivals, one after another, with expressions of
disappointment and disgust on their features, seemed
to melt away into a surrounding forest of trees that
were very black and very like shadows. The dreamer
in her dream betook herself to prayer that the God of
mercy might change what she saw.</p>

<p>Then she beheld the Paphian goddess in all the splendor
of her form, a perfect triumph of nature, just as
depicted by bard and painter, looking out contemptuously,
pitilessly, toward her former votaries, now aged
and pushed aside. There came then a voice as if from
above: “<i>God is love.</i>”</p>

<p>Immediately on the face of the divinity there was an
expression as of terror, and she began sinking. Before
the mind of the dreamer, the beautiful creature, and
her retinue of nude, bold-faced attendants, with all that
appertained to them and their queen went down, ingulfed
in a foaming, roaring whirlpool. As they
went down lightnings from above shot after them.
And the dreamer looked aloft to see from whence the
voice and the lightning came. As she gazed upward
she saw a man of noble form, reverently bowing, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
son might bow in the presence of a mother revered and
loved, before a woman of noble mien and beautiful beyond
all compare.</p>

<p>But this one’s beauty had no similitude to that of
the departed deity. As the maiden gazed she discerned
that the man was the one her heart called
lover, the woman the one she had enshrined as the
ideal of her soul, Mary. The twain stood above her,
on a plain, apparently of clouds very bright, rising in
graceful curve from the earth and stretching away in
measureless vistas, filled with flowered parks, silvery
rivers and stately mountains. Along the rivers, amid
the flowery plains and on the verdant mountains, there
were numerous buildings; but these latter were inviting;
not palatial, nor stately. They were homes surrounded
by family groups. And the dreamer discerned
true love triumphant and fruitful. She lingered
in this presence, anon longing for a presentment of her
self amid the scenes of pleasure, until all was suddenly
dissolved by a mighty lurch of the ship that awakened
her. She started from her couch and all immediately
before the dream came back to her mind.</p>

<p>“We’re in a storm on the Mediterranean, and the captain
is anxious!” Her nerves were now unstrung; a
woman’s timorousness was upon her. She could hear
confused noises aloft, but no voices. For a moment
she questioned: “What if all but myself have been
swept away?” Then she thought of herself as drifting
about in a ship, sailless, helmless, alone! The
thought was suffocating. The noises aloft continued,
and she gave strained attention to catch the sound of
a voice. There was nothing to be heard but the creaking
of timbers, the dashing of waves, the shrieking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
winds and vague thumpings, as if parts of the vessel
were beating each other to pieces.</p>

<p>“I’ll not lie still in this coffin!” she exclaimed, and
with a bound she made her way to the deck. As she
arrived there she thought she saw dark forms, some
crouching as if for shelter, and others as if engaged in
a great struggle. Were these demons, or the crew in
a struggle for life? She could not say. Then there
came a cry from the direction of the forward part of
the ship; she thought it was her father’s voice, but it
was very hoarse and scarcely recognizable.</p>

<p>She listened again to the cry: “Ho, ho; ye Olympian
demons! tear up the sea, charge now! Ha, ha; have
at us!” The cry thrilled her. Again the wild voice
rose above the storm:</p>

<p>“Bury her, my darling, if ye dare! What matter!
her white soul has eternal wings!”</p>

<p>She was certain it was her father. She longed to
rush to his side, but she doubted whether she could
find him in the darkness; then, too, even in the terrors
of the moment, her maiden modesty asserted itself.
She remembered that she was but partly clad.</p>

<p>Again came that voice, wilder than before: “Ye billows,
dare ye smite a knight in the face? I’ll meet your
challenge, and single-handed, in your midst, fight!”</p>

<p>Miriamne’s heart was almost paralyzed by the
thought, “The boisterousness has overcome my father.
He’s contemplating leaping into the sea!”</p>

<p>Just then a vivid flash of lightning made every thing
visible. It seemed to cut under the clouds, which,
rain-charged, were running near the billow crests, and
at the same time enswathed the ship from the mast
tips to the partially exposed keel, in flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden saw by that flash her father standing on
the head-rail, one hand clinging to a stay rope, the
other with clinched fist, as if menacing the boiling
waters that leaped away from the plunging prow. His
face was livid, his hair wind-tossed, his eyes glaring.
With a scream she bounded toward him; her scream
and appearance terrifying the sailors. It was so unexpected
and they had forgotten the presence of a
woman on board. They only saw a white form, with
disheveled hair and with a motion light and swift as a
creature on wings, passing from companion-way forward.</p>

<p>But the fright was but momentary. Cornelius, who
had been vainly endeavoring to calm the knight, knew
the form, and loud enough to be heard by all cried:</p>

<p>“Miriamne de Griffin!”</p>

<p>He was by her side in an instant.</p>

<p>The young woman uttered pleadingly one sentence,
but it thrilled all who heard it:</p>

<p>“My father!”</p>

<p>Cornelius exultingly answered:</p>

<p>“Saved! See, the captain holds him and has summoned
the watch!” Then he could do no less, forgetting
as he did in the present surprise, all old resolves,
so he drew the trembling form to his heart as
closely as he could. She drew back a little, but he
whispered, “Miriamne.” What else he might have
said was lost, for she fluttered a little, then rested, but
on the bosom of her companion.</p>

<p>She was a woman in peril, in fright, storm-drenched,
and in love. What otherwise or less could she have
done than nestle in the shelter that gave love for love
and promised her all else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you not alarmed, Cornelius?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How strange! You have changed places with me.
In the evening you trembled when I left you, and I
thought I was very brave. Now I tremble; do you not?”</p>

<p>“I cowered a while ago from the cross you presented
me; it seemed to bring a lingering death.”</p>

<p>Just then the ship’s prow plunged under a mountainous
billow. Miriamne clung to her support and fearfully
questioned:</p>

<p>“Shall we be overwhelmed?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ve a token.”</p>

<p>“From the captain?”</p>

<p>“Not from the one who guides this ship alone.”</p>

<p>A flash of lightning revealed the lover’s face to Miriamne.
She saw his eyes turned devoutly upward, and
she understood his meaning. They had withdrawn to
a shelter by the vessel’s side meanwhile. Presently
the young missioner spoke again;</p>

<p>“Our Heavenly Father keeps vigil, I think, sometimes
with especial care over this highway between the
outer world and the desolate habitations of His chosen
people.”</p>

<p>“Hark, the sailors are singing! How strange it is
to sing in such perils,” spoke the maiden.</p>

<p>“They’re as happy now as the wave-walking petrels.
The Levant has done its worst; they know this by
the coming of the rain, hence they sing their ‘Lightning
Song.’”</p>

<p>“Lightning song?” queried the maiden.</p>

<p>“Listen! How they explode their vocalized breaths
in hissings, whizzings, followed by the prolonged crash
made by stamping feet and clapping hands at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
of every stanza. That chorus is meant to imitate
those heralds of the thunder, the flashing lightnings.”</p>

<p>“But it seems presumptuous to me. The lightning
is so dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Not that which comes as ‘a funeral torch to Euroclydon,’
as the sailors say. Some of them call it ‘the
winking and blinking of St. Elmo going to sleep.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cornelius, the storm is breaking! I see a star;
yes two!” rapturously cried the maiden.</p>

<p>“Truly, yes; ‘Castor and Pollux,’ the ‘Twins,’ the
‘Sailor’s Delight!’ They say these stars are storm
rulers and friends of the mariner. Now hear how they
shout their song! They see the stars!”</p>

<p>Above the subsiding wind and waves, rose the words
of the singers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Now to our harbor safe going;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Riding the billows, pushed by the gale:</div>
<div class="verse">The torch of the Twins bright glowing—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Tipping our mast and gilding each sail.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And do these stars assure, Cornelius?”</p>

<p>“I saw a star no cloud can ever hide, through the
darkest part of the storm.”</p>

<p>“A star?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘Mary, Star of Sea.’”</p>

<p>“I do not comprehend you.”</p>

<p>“God’s love! He that guided the maiden orphan
of Bethlehem through the besetments of her life, amid
the tempests of Jewry and Rome, purely, safely, gloriously,
to the end; while many of noble birth and having
every earthly good went down to ruin, walks ever
on the wave where faith voyages.”</p>

<p>“And you thought of the Holy Mother in the
storm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, this Adriatic is full of angels, that come in
thoughts, or before the eyes! You remember Paul,
tempest tossed a day and a night on this sea, was found
by the Divine Messenger that night when the darkness
was thickest?”</p>

<p>“And this ‘Star of the Sea?’”</p>

<p>“It tells me mother-love was carried by a dying
Savior into the heart of the Triune, Eternal God, and
we are His children, and He became Father and Mother
to us. You have seen the hen gather her chickens, as
human mother shelters with her arm or apron her child
in pain or peril?”</p>

<p>“How touching! Think you He felt for us like tenderness
in the height of the storm?”</p>

<p>“He sought in His plenteous wisdom mother love
to sustain Himself, during the pain and perils of His
incarnation, and will ever surely grant a love and care
to His own beloved ones in suffering or danger as tender
as that He sought and needed for Himself.”</p>

<p>“Surely this is a grateful, natural reasoning; but do
you believe Mary presides over the sailor especially?”</p>

<p>“It is enough for me to know that the Father
through Mary exemplified His motherliness.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never more call yon bright luminaries Castor
and Pollux, but rather Jesus and Mary, the guides and
the defenders!” And for a long time they gazed at the
double stars, the storm slowly abating. Once the youth,
drawing the maiden closely to himself, questioned:</p>

<p>“Can not we call the stars in conjunction, ‘Cornelius
and Miriamne’?”</p>

<p>They had been watching, in sweet converse, there, a
long time; there were faint traces of dawn in the east,
and Miriamne had just been thinking, “Palestine receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
us with illumination;” then she bethought herself
that she and the man with her were going hither
to proclaim the Gospel of eternal light. The question
of her lover recalled the converse of the day before.
That seemed fact, unchanged; all occurring since,
dream. She arose, pointed eastward, and firmly said:
“There lies our work, our all. May a glorious day
enhalo all God’s chosen country ere long. Cornelius,
yesterday we promised solemnly that we dare not turn
from now; especially after our wonderful deliverance!”
She glided away to her cabin, leaving the man alone
to contemplate the poor comfort of being praised as a
martyr, on a cross of self-sacrifice; the pains of which,
if not as awful as those of Calvary, were destined to
be more prolonged. His face was as if sprinkled with
white ashes; it was so pale, so blank. After the tempest
they spoke very little with each other. Miriamne
waved away any attempt at re-opening the subject, with
a motion of the finger to the lips, signaling silence, and
a glance all tenderness, but full of pitiful pleadings to
be spared. The young man but once or twice essayed
the discussion, fearing on the one hand to trust himself
to speak, and on the other hand feeling that any effort
to change his fate would be hopeless. But he and she
were full of inner conflicts. Then their pathways
seemed stony, brier-tangled. They had both elected,
for Guide and Ideal, Jesus and Mary; they were both
going toward the cross in a noble consecration of their
lives. But they denied themselves that that sustained
Jesus, home love, such as he found at Bethany; conjugal
love, such as sustained Mary, the wife and the
mother, as well as the disciple. They had as their loftiest
ambition the purpose of making the world happier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
and better, and began by making misery for themselves.
They had read that a star led the wise men of the
East to Christ in a cradle, the light of the Gospel
rising first in a little home circle. They looked at the
double stars above them after the storm that night
almost until dawn, and then turned away to go, each
into the dark like a lone wandering star. Each was in
part the victim of a fabricated conscience, and of a misconception
of duty.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">For many days Sir Charleroy and Miriamne
tarried at Acre, the latter seeking to banish
repining on account of him whom she
had sent away at the behest of conscience,
by ministries for her parent. With alacrity she joined
the tours of her knightly father, visiting the scenes
where he once battled, listening, from time to time, with
unaffected delight, to his recitals. The tides of fanatical
conquests had wrought few changes on the face of
the city, and the realism of those days of siege, of the
stern compacts made in the last hours of the Crusaders,
the solemn religious services before the last battle, the
death struggle and the disordered retreat, was complete.
The excitement of revived memories seemed
to lift up the knight from the syncope of ill health.
This encouraged the maiden to solicit the reviews and
recitals of her father. The night before their departure
from Acre, as determined, the knight and his
daughter stood together contemplating the sacred pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
which stood in the moonlight and shadows, mostly in
shadows. The soldier of fortune, having told its story
over and over, was now silent, dreaming of the past.</p>

<p>“<i>Selamet!</i>”</p>

<p>They both started, for the voice was like one from
the tomb, none but themselves being apparent.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid here; let’s be going, father,” whispered
Miriamne, essaying to withdraw.</p>

<p>Thereupon there glided out of the shadows a stately
form who, drawing near to the father and daughter,
spoke:</p>

<p>“Fear not, lady! Knight, they can not be foes who
court kindred memories and hope of like colors at the
same shrine!”</p>

<p>“Thou speakest with Christian allusions the ‘peace’
word of the Turk.”</p>

<p>“I wear the Turkish ‘<i>selamet</i>,’ as I do this Turkish
harness, a loathed necessity, but without; the peace I
pray and feel is the mystic inner peace.”</p>

<p>“As a Christian?”</p>

<p>“Yea; nor do I fear confession, since I am speaking
to those who abhor the Crescent.”</p>

<p>“A pious Jew would as soon adhere to Astarte with
her orgies as to bow to the mooned-crown she wore.”</p>

<p>“Jews? No, not Jews! Such would not sooner
run from the moon-mark than they would from the
shadows which fall down about you from yon grand
and awful sign.”</p>

<p>The speaker pointed to the crossed spire above, as
he spoke.</p>

<p>“No more avoidance; we are brethren. I’m Sir
Charleroy de Griffin, Teutonic knight.”</p>

<p>“And not unknown. The story of thy valor, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
here, lives in the bosoms of true companions. I’m a
Knight Hospitaler of Rhodes, yet fameless.”</p>

<p>The two men came closely together; there were a
few secret tests. The Hospitaler said:</p>

<p>“<i>In hoc signo vinces!</i>”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy crossed his feet, stretched out his
arms and murmured something heard only by his comrade.
It made the other’s eyes lighten with pleasure.</p>

<p>To Miriamne it was a dumb show; but the tokens
given and received were useful to pilgrims in those
perilous times.</p>

<p>“Whither, Sir Charleroy?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, toward Joppa.”</p>

<p>“So, ho! By interpretation, <i>The Watch-tower of Joy</i>.
From thence one may see Jerusalem! And then?”</p>

<p>“And then? God knows where! A useless life, like
mine, is ever aimless.”</p>

<p>“No, no, father!” interrupted the daughter; “not
useless. No life that God prolongs is useless.”</p>

<p>“True; the girl is right, Teuton. Aspiration will
cure thee, since it’s the mother of immortality. I go
to Joppa also.”</p>

<p>“They say, Hospitaler, its sea-side is full wild; its
reefs like barking Scylla and Charybdis? I hope it
may be so; I’d like a terrible uproar.”</p>

<p>“The sea is the emblem of change; from calm to
weary moan, to howling terrors and back again.”</p>

<p>“But the people? They say Joppa’s outside is fine,
naturally, though, within, the life of its people is mean,
colorless; a charnel-house whose activity is that of
grave worms!” And Sir Charleroy shuddered with
disgust at his own figure.</p>

<p>“I think the legend of Andromeda, said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
been chained to Joppa’s sea-crags for a season, to be
persecuted by a serpent, then freed, prophetic. Joppa
may have a future.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the chained maiden was boasted by her fond
mother as more beautiful than Neptune’s Nereids,
hence the persecution. Crescent faiths have been the
persecutors of Joppa and all the other beautiful
Andromedas of this land.”</p>

<p>“And the chains are riveted?”</p>

<p>“No, not certainly. There was, in the myth, a Perseus
of winged feet, having a helmet that made invisible
and a sickle from Minerva, goddess of wisdom;
he slew the serpent, then wed the victim.”</p>

<p>“Now the key, further.”</p>

<p>“When wrongs overwhelm all, women suffer most;
but time brings their deliverance.”</p>

<p>“The myths are as full of women as the women
full of myths!” exclaimed Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“But Andromeda, the woman, was blameless!”</p>

<p>“Yet it’s strange that in all men’s fightings, as in
their religions, constantly the woman appears,” replies
Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“I’d have thee think, knight, of the legend; it tells
how men, in those dark times, tied their faith to the
sure conviction that right would triumph, wrong be
slain, and the martyrs at last go up among the stars.
See how they placed their Andromeda in the constellation
now above us. Perseus was a Christian, or rather
a Christian was a Perseus.”</p>

<p>“Now, thou art merry!”</p>

<p>“No; I mean St. Peter; he was a Perseus. Hearken
to the word:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named
Tabitha: this woman was full of good works and
alms-deeds.</p>

<p>“‘And it came to pass that she died.</p>

<p>“‘The disciples sent unto Peter two men, desiring
him that he would not delay to come to them.</p>

<p>“‘When he was come, they brought him into the
upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him
weeping, and showing the coats and garments which
she made, while she was with them.</p>

<p>“‘But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down,
and prayed; and turning him to the body, said, Tabitha,
arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she
saw Peter, she sat up.</p>

<p>“‘And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up; and
when he had called the saints and widows, he presented
her alive.</p>

<p>“‘And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many
believed in the Lord.’”</p>

<p>“Why, Hospitaler, thou hast a memory like an elephant
or an emperor and a tongue like a sacrist!”</p>

<p>“Well, the time for swords being past I have taken
to books; their leaves are wings. The world will be
conquered yet by the words of the Swordless King.”</p>

<p>“And thou wouldst liken Tabitha to Andromeda?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she a real beauty, as her name is interpreted?
Beautiful old soul! She robed the poor!
Peter bringing her to the truth of the new life smote
the dragon at Joppa, as a very Perseus.”</p>

<p>“A woman! a woman, again leading the army of
salvation!”</p>

<p>“After that Peter slept on the house top of Simon
the Tanner, and God gave him the vision of Jew and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
Gentile, bond and free, rich and poor; all, as one family
coming into the benign rays of the Sun whose wings
are full of healing.”</p>

<p>“And will that day come, Sir Hospitaler? I’m feeling
almost a frenzy of desire for it!”</p>

<p>“Surely as the morning to Acre; but we must hie
homeward; good-night; I’ll see you at the quay
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>From Acre, Miriamne and her father, next day, set
sail. The companions on the journey from Acre
by Joppa arrived at Jerusalem, there to separate
soon, for Miriamne, with every ingenious device,
urged her father forward. Bozrah was constantly
uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p>“We part, Sir Charleroy, to-morrow?” said the
Hospitaler.</p>

<p>“If thou dost elect to stay in sad Jerusalem, surely.</p>

<p>“Yes; I’d go mad here from doing nothing but
wrestling with my thoughts. In fact, I guess I’d go
mad anywhere, if long there. I think, sometimes,
that my mind’s in a whirlpool, moving not like
others; yet, round and round in some consistency,
carrying its befooling creeds, hopes, dreams, visions,
phantasmagoria in a pretty fair march. I’m sure, more
than sure, that if I once stopped moving, my brain
would rest like a house after a land-slide, tilted over,
while all the things in the whirlpool would drift about
in hopeless confusion.”</p>

<p>“Thou dost talk like a physician, gone mad with
philosophy!”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it; that’s all because I’ve been idling
here a month; a week longer and God knows who
could set me going again, rightly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the knight laughed merrily; very merrily, in
fact, for a man who had trained himself to morbidness.
The Hospitaler replied:</p>

<p>“I see nothing for me beyond the Holy City and its
historic surrounds. I’m training myself to proclaim
God’s kingdom and must begin at that pre-eminent,
world over-looking point, Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“But there are no schools to fit one there?”</p>

<p>“The most informing and man-expanding on earth;
the deathless examples of the worthies; best studied
where they lived their mightful living. I go now to
Golgotha.”</p>

<p>“Golgotha? ‘The Place of the Skull?’”</p>

<p>“Even so, sometimes called the Valley of Jehosaphat.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy rubbed his head as one well puzzled,
and was silent.</p>

<p>“Oh, knight, thou hast forgotten the goings forward
of Ezekiel’s mind, prophetically. It was in Kidron,
the Golgotha Valley, that he had the vision of the dry
bones. Let me read:</p>

<p>“‘Behold, there were very many bones in the open
valley; and, lo, they were very dry.</p>

<p>“‘And He said unto me, Son of man, can these bones
live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest.</p>

<p>“‘Again He said unto me, Prophesy;</p>

<p>“‘Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold,
I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:</p>

<p>“‘As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a
shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his
bone.</p>

<p>“‘The sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and
the skin covered them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Then said he unto me, say to the wind, Thus saith
the Lord God; come from the four winds, O breath,
and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</p>

<p>“‘So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the
breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up
upon their feet, an exceeding great army.’”</p>

<p>“And now, soldier, turned exegete, tell me what
thou dost make of the strange phantasm?”</p>

<p>“That God will work in this world a marvelous
transformation; those living-dead, all around us and
beyond, to the ends of the earth, shall stand in new
life. The scene is laid to be in this Kidron valley, to
bring all minds to the ‘Light of the World,’ who
passed in painful triumph along it, even unto Calvary.”</p>

<p>“But this may not be so, yet it so seems?”</p>

<p>“Hearken again to the prophet’s happy ending:</p>

<p>“‘Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with
them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them:
and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set
my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.</p>

<p>“‘My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will
be their God, and they shall be my people.’</p>

<p>“All this,” continued the Hospitaler, “is what is to
come, is coming. The dawn of this day began when
Jesus passed over Kidron!”</p>

<p>“And yet, Rhodes, I’m doubtful. Do not the correspondences
remote, mislead thee?”</p>

<p>“If a crusade leader sent a summons like this
wouldst thou respond, trusting? ‘Blow ye the trumpet
in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain:
let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> cometh, for <i>it is</i> nigh at hand?’”</p>

<p>“The Hospitaler knows I would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well; God by His Prophet-Herald, Joel, so alarms
the nations. And more, we have a broader summons,”
and the preacher soldier read again:</p>

<p>“‘Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision:
for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.</p>

<p>“‘Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the
valley of Jehosaphat: for there will I sit to judge all
the heathen round about.</p>

<p>“‘Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.</p>

<p>“‘The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the
stars shall withdraw their shining.</p>

<p>“‘The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter His
voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth
shall shake: but the Lord <i>will</i> be the hope of His people,
and the strength of the children of Israel.</p>

<p>“‘So shall ye know that I <i>am</i> the Lord your God
dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.</p>

<p>“‘Beat your plowshares into swords, and your
pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am
strong.’”</p>

<p>Then the Hospitaler closed his eyes, turned his face
upward as in prayer, and began speaking like unto one
in a rapture or trance:</p>

<p>“When souls would measure themselves for judgment,
they must stand by the scenes wrought out by
Him that died for men; just hereabouts, when the
last judgment comes, the multitudes of earth, tried by
the measure of the God-man, will be brought face to
face with God’s standard of moral grandeur, sublimely
once displayed here. Before its splendor the stars,
the finest of men, shall wax dim; human philosophy,
the sun of the world, go out, and human religion, ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
the child of human desire, shall fade as the setting,
waning moon, that emblem of the concupiscent. Then
Charity, that never fails, shall come to her throne, the
last implement of war be beaten into services of love,
while the weak, no more dominated by giant brutality,
shall rise to the pre-eminence of moral strength. Adam
and Eve, the fallen pair, passed through the valley of
sorrow and sin, downward; Christ and Madonna, the
new ideals, passed through the valley of sorrow and
salvation, upward.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rhodes, the whirl of my brain is as if touched
by the swellings of an anthem. I’ll come right yet,
if thou dost enravish me so!” cried Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>And Miriamne’s face shone as if the sun were on it,
but it was not. She was looking away, in soul, to the
future. The Hospitaler continued:</p>

<p>“Truly, all heads, as well as hearts, are righted here,
where the touch of the Cross makes the dry bones
live. Here get I my schooling; this place of the
Cross, where the depths of sin, the heights of love, are
manifest; from which radiates all holiest tenets, to
which and from which flow the streams of Scriptural
truth. If only we could get all men to stand sincerely
on this lofty hill of vision, overlooking all times to
come, all histories past, all mysteries would be explained,
all prophecies become clear, and there never
would be need on earth again for wars of faith or the
burning of heretics. Pilate spake welcome words to
the ages when he cried: ‘<i>Miles, expedi Crucem</i>’—‘Soldiers,
speed the Cross.’ Its speed is light’s speed.”</p>

<p>As they conversed, the three had slowly journeyed
along the <i>Via Dolorosa</i>—the road to the Cross.</p>

<p>“Here,” said the Hospitaler, “it is reported that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Jesus yearningly looking back to the weeping women
that followed him Cross-ward, cried: ‘<i>Daughters of
Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and
children.</i>’”</p>

<p>“The woman again in religion!” exclaimed Sir
Charleroy.</p>

<p>“Immanuel spoke to the world, then. When truth
goes to crucifixion, women and children—the weaker—may
well weep. It’s the Giant’s hour. So children
and women ever have been the chief followers of
Jesus. No wonder that children brought palms of
peace to Him and shouted His praises, while women
anointed Him with tears. They knew, by an holy intuition,
that somehow He was the King of Love, the
defender of weakness.”</p>

<p>“I begin to think, Sir Knight Hospitaler, that the
sun of this country has wrapped its gold about thy
brain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, don’t prevent; these words of his are
balm to my soul,” quoth Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Speak on, for the girl’s sake, knight. Speak on;
I’ll be silent.”</p>

<p>The Hospitaler continued:</p>

<p>“Daughter, thou dost follow the story as those holy
women followed Jesus, afar off; but with tenderness.
As they found later unutterable nearness, so shalt
thou; God willing.”</p>

<p>“The woman in religion! It’s so. I, a man; this
Miriamne, a woman, a girl, my daughter. I’m like a
pupil to her, yet I professed this cross-faith more than
a score of years before she was born. I’d need a millennium
to overtake her, in glory, if we both died now.
I’m like poor old David, who fled from his rebellious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
son, Absalom, over the hills that skirt Kidron. I’m
dethroned.”</p>

<p>“Remember, rather, that He who glorified Kidron
was ‘obedient unto death.’ Mother and son, together
all loving, all loyal in that dread hour, here attested
that in David’s kingdom, at the last, at its best, there
will be no trampling on the family ties, Sir Charleroy.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful! I never thought of this before, after
this manner. But still, the woman leads the world
in religion!”</p>

<p>“<i>The</i> woman! Yes, but only when she takes her
place, as did Mary, as a follower of Jesus to Calvary.”</p>

<p>“But how, now, about Astarte, Diana, Baaltis?”</p>

<p>“They had their day; rude, gross phantoms; conceived
in the hot souls of low and lecherous men; but I
told thee, here we might overlook the world. In this
valley Athaliah, daughter of cruel Jezebel, Queen of
Ahab, and, like her mother, an Astarte-socialist, worshiped
the lewd ideal, Baaltis. Death, in shocking
form, took off that heathen queen of Israel. God’s
revenge, this was.</p>

<p>“And now, I remember that the queen mother of Asa,
here, in Kidron, set up the worship of Ashera with its
Phallic mysteries; but Asa, the youth, pure of mind
and led of God, not only tore down, root and branch
the groves and woven booths of licentiousness, but dethroned
the woman who had set them up. Just here,
in finest contrasts, I remember the Virgin Mary, the
pure mother, the ideal woman, who, in this valley of
decision, rose for all time the exemplification of truest
womanhood—a wife, a mother. Mary has broken forever
the idols of Baaltis. While Mary’s memory lasts,
part of the enduring, sacred history, toward which all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
Christian eyes turn, Astarte can never rise under any
name or form for long toleration. She is forever broken,
and her creed of lust fated to reprobation.</p>

<p>“Wherever this gospel story, eternal and eternally
new, is told, there will come to the minds of the hearers a
vision of those associated in the last dread hours of the
Divine Martyr, in a fellowship of sympathy and sorrow.
Among these will stand pre-eminent the women.
Simon, the Cyrenian, compelled by the soldiers, aided
the trembling sorrow-burdened Christ to bear the
cross. And it is easy to believe that the wife of that
Simon, who appears later, for a moment, in the praiseful
salutations of Paul, as the parent of Christian sons,
she reverently called by the great apostle mother, was
among the women that were most sorrowful and nearest
the dying Saviour. Then there were Mary, the mother of
James, Salome, Mary Magdalene, and possibly Claudia
the wife of Pilate—that brave woman who advocated
Christ’s cause before the proud, implacable Sanhedrim,
the howling mob and Imperial Rome’s representatives.
What fitting mourners in that touching, yet august
funeral march!</p>

<p>“Women are fully capable by nature, through their
finest, tenderest chords, ever responsive in woe, to express
the whole of grief, however deep! The sex
which loves most, loves longest, mourns most easily as
well as most sincerely, and has made sorrow sacred by
the lavish bestowals of it, whene’er its founts were
touched.</p>

<p>“There is an holy, perfumed anointing in their tears.
This crucifixion-time was woman’s hour supremely.
Mary with <i>magnificent</i> self-possession, heart-broken,
yet strong in faith; weeping in eye and soul, but intruding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
no wild howlings amid those who wept for custom’s
sake; tearful, yet retiring in her grief, here
passes before our minds at once the most fascinating,
winsome, yet pity-begetting woman known to man.”</p>

<p>“Father,” cried Miriamne, restraining but little her
own tears: “Are you listening?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; oh, yes. The glory of Eden’s noon has
fallen on the tongue and brain of Rhodes, and yet I
cannot gainsay him; nor would I try to dispel his wise
and honored sayings. I can only wonder and wonder
how it is that woman rises at the very front when any
grand advance is made.”</p>

<p>“Good Rhodes, go on,” spoke Miriamne.</p>

<p class="caption-r">B. Plockhorst.</p>
<p class="caption">MARY AND ST. JOHN.</p>
</div>

<p>“I’m easily persuaded, for there is something of a
savory sweetness to this grief—welcome mother of true
penitence, that comes over souls, who, in imagination,
follow the steps to the cross. I’ve heard that Mary
followed her son from the Judgment Hall to Calvary.
He moved at slow pace, and well He might; worn by
months of toil for needy humanity; by watchings,
teachings and the like; until now ready to drop down
under the thorn-crown, the scourging and the cross.
But the blessed Virgin, still a woman, still a mother,
faltered by the way. Sometimes she hid her eyes from
the scourging, sometimes she was pushed aside by
those who knew her not, or those who knowing hated
her because of her goodness. Tradition tells us she
fainted several times overcome by the terrors of that
sad journey through the valley. She had small
strength to witness the climax of brutality when
cruel hands drove the awful nails into that One she
loved! The history of that dread hour has often
wrung tears from stout hearts; and he who understands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
in any degree a mother’s heart, easily believes
that she was absent when the mob raised the victim
on His cross. But, mother-like, nothing could keep
her from the final parting, which death brought to
her and her son.</p>

<p>“Sorrow sharpens the language of love to a deep expressiveness;
when the end was approaching, Mary and
John stood side by side and near to the One, who, to
them, was dearer than all. I have heard, and I believe
that a sign from the Christ had hurried John away, just
before His death, to bring mother to the heart that was
yearning not more to give than to receive, the comforts
that both needed, the assurance of undying affection.
The man on the cross, stripped of all earthly except
His flesh, even robbed of the tunic that Mary had
made, and for which the men of war gambled, as war
has often gambled for the patrimony of the King of
Men, had little or nothing of earth to give, other than
His rights in the hearts of mother and John.</p>

<p>“These were His farewell keepsakes to each. It needs
no strained imagination to fathom His heart, for He
opened it all in His dying cry, ‘My God, my God, why
hast Thou forsaken me?’ This was not as the cry of a
victor, but that of a broken heart; not as a strong man,
but typical humanity, alone, facing death as a child.
The language He used then was not that usually His,
it was the language of His childhood. In every
syllable of that cry, one may read, I fear that God,
even God, has forsaken me; but mother, my own loved
mother! mother, mother, oh, my dying, human heart,
leans as a babe on thy bosom!’”</p>

<p>“Here, here!” cried Sir Charleroy. “Quick! Take
this cross of a Teutonic Knight of St. Mary; bury it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
when I’m gone by her grave in Gethsemane! I have
praised myself as her champion, and son, and devotee.
Heavens! I’m abashed by thy splendid revelation!
I never have even dreamed of her glorious worth!”</p>

<p>“Father, my father, be calm, be calm—calm for my
sake; you fright me when you so give way. Remember,
we’re at the place where a wrong past ends at the
right beginning.”</p>

<p>“Thou art my good angel, Miriamne; but, oh, it’s
twice sad! I’ve been a madman half my life and a
player in a farce the other half!”</p>

<p>“Be calm, Sir Knight, and look into the wonders of
this place. Christ’s coming to earth to pardon its
errings, right its wrongs, and hang unfading victory
crowns on all futures. Listen: There was night when
that King died, and the dead arose and went about the
city, attesting the eternal fact that He was Ruler of all
worlds. And it was the Feast of the New Moon
at Jerusalem; the Feast of Venus at Rome; of Khem
in Egypt; but the crescent was hidden.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see, Rhodes; Mary and Mary’s son were to
come forth; all others eclipsed!”</p>

<p>“It is attested by history that there was black darkness
about the Sun Temple at Heliopolis as Christ was
bidding His mother and earth Death’s good-night.
The Egyptian city of Osiris, by miracle, witnessed of
the great event at Calvary. Some there were prompted
to say: ‘Either the world is coming to an end, or the
god of nature suffers.’”</p>

<p>“And Mary, wise and erudite, Rhodes? Tell us
more of her.”</p>

<p>“‘It is finished!’ cried her son, and she passed
from the grief of those who agonize amid somber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
monster pangs impending, into that quiet, subdued,
ripening sadness that comes over those who have
learned to say: ‘<i>Thy will be done.</i>’ At Cana’s feast
her Beloved told her: ‘<i>Mine hour has not yet come.</i>’
Now, she knew the meaning of the mystic words, and
saw His hour, with all its mighty imports, at last
marked in full; all the prophecies gathered as into a
full-orbed sun; the cross rose like a dial, mountains
high, the shadows on it telling eternity’s time! Mary,
the singer of the ‘<i>Magnificat</i>,’ her imagination fired,
her vision inspired, as she stood by that interpreting,
ghastly symbol, could see the course of the sacred past
emerging into meaning. Eve leading; the wealth of
her bloom no longer sacrificed to primeval, Astarte-like
intoxications; the wings of the real tree of life
above her; the serpent crushed beneath her heel.
Then, following, Noah, the man of the ark, symbol of
sheltering covenants between God and man, covenants
ever circled by bows of hope, ever surmounted by
dove-like peace. After these Abraham, with his typical
lamb, followed by a countless multitude of priests,
laying down at the cross, as they passed, their temple-pattern,
the symbols of its service realized and ellipsed!
After these, Moses, the law-giver, with face serene at
law’s fulfillment, in company with flaming prophets
innumerable, all rejoicing in visions realized. Behind
all followed Captivity and Hades, Christ’s grandest
trophies, forever in chains! Teutonic Knight of St.
Mary, thy queen saw all these, and as they passed
there rose to her view the White Kingdom of David.
Now, stand here where she stood; surrender mind and
heart to the Spirit and Word, then thou shalt behold
the radiant procession, the coming glory!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hospitaler ceased. Then softly, meanwhile
waving his hand as if entreating, Sir Charleroy spoke:</p>

<p>“Rhodes, wait a little; don’t say any more now.
I want to watch that procession. It seems to me I
see it. Oh, wonderful, all wonderful!”</p>

<p>“He shall be called Wonderful.”</p>

<p>There was a long, long pause, broken gently by
Miriamne, who, after a while, said:</p>

<p>“We’d better return to the city; the day is very hot,
and I’m—” She could say no more.</p>

<p>Silently Sir Charleroy complied; silently all three
journeyed to their abodes. The Hospitaler was content
with his effort to proclaim the truths of Calvary,
and Miriamne was glad to leave her father to the full
benefit of his sacred, all-engrossing thoughts. Miriamne,
in heart, was enraptured by her thoughts of
the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Under Miriamne’s adroit and patient guidance
Sir Charleroy and his attendants
made goodly progress until they reached
ancient Jabbock, bordering Giant Bashan;
but at that point the knight made a stubborn stand,
persisting that he would proceed no further Bozrah-ward.</p>

<p>“I smell Mohammedanism coming to me from the

ingenuity could invent opposed to the proposed deflection
in course. She enlisted the Druses guides, whom
she had employed to accompany them hitherto, to aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
her in raising objections, and they magnified the
obstacles in the way to Gerash with commendable
loyalty to their employer, the maiden, if not with strict
regard to truth. They all encamped, and the debate
was the sole occupation for hours.</p>

<p>“Now, Miriamne, hitherto my good spirit, thou
wouldst lure me to perdition! I’ve been in the Lejah.
I’m certain that black lava-sea is hell’s mouth, and
Bozrah’s its porch!”</p>

<p>“So be it; but if we go carrying the heavenly consciousness
of doing our Father’s will, we may carry
heaven to those gates.”</p>

<p>“It’s not my duty to go thither. I passed through
that purgatory once. Its horrors blasted my life! To
return thither would be presumption.”</p>

<p>“But you have forgotten the sunrise coming to you.
Each day, for months, as you have journeyed eastward,
you have gained in health of body and
mind.”</p>

<p>“Dost thou mean that God blesses those who
plunge headlong to destruction, as the possessed swine
that ran violently into the sea?”</p>

<p>“Can not my father let faith silence the disquietings
of his wild fancies? The memory of a past pain,
though a persistent, is often a false teacher.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do remember. Some memories seem to
scorch the very substance of my brain! I pray when
such come that God give me eternal forgetfulness. I’d
rather be an idiot than have the power of coherent
thinking filled with such reminiscences!”</p>

<p>“Ah, if we all, always, had the wisdom, while gazing
into our dark, deep pools, to gaze until we saw at their
bottoms the image of the sky above!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well said, daughter! Bozrah is a dark pool! I
saw there only an image of the sky, and that very far
away!”</p>

<p>The day of the foregoing they were wandering along
the flowery banks and over the forest-covered hills
that undulated away from Jabbock’s ravine. As they
moved along the maiden plucked a hyacinth blossom
and affectionately fastened it on her father’s bosom;
just where he was wont to wear, when in England, his
knight’s cross.</p>

<p>“Rizpah once placed a lotus there; it made me
drunk; a votary of pleasure, mad; but Miriamne, her
daughter, places there the flower of serene, deathless
affection! Sweet, thou art my good angel, the flower
says to Gerash!”</p>

<p>“Why, father! I do not understand!”</p>

<p>“Apollo unwittingly caused the death of a beautiful
youth, the friend of his heart, whose name was Hyacinthus.
So says tradition, and it’s so charming, I
more than half believe it! Apollo, in loyal love, made
a flower grow from the grave of his friend. This is it!
See; here’s the color of the dead youth’s blood. This
blossom is the flower of deathless friendship and I love
it.”</p>

<p>“A touching story, I’ll remember it; but it seems
to me the flower says, ‘Bozrah,’ my father.”</p>

<p>“Take this leaf, girl; here.”</p>

<p>“And what of this?”</p>

<p>“There, on that leaf, behold those signs, ‘Ai’ ‘Ai’.”</p>

<p>“I think some markings are there like what you say,
though never ’till now did I so trace them.”</p>

<p>“That’s the Greek cry of woe. The perfumes of
these flowers, in every field of Gerash, remind me of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
my duty. I must go to the tomb of the man that died
in my defense.”</p>

<p>“A pious sentiment; but duty to the living can not
be pushed aside by such a call. You have other and
living friends?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thou art my friend, lover, angel; but I’ll keep
thee with me, my lamb.”</p>

<p>“Rizpah and your sons!”</p>

<p>“Rizpah my friend? that would be amusing, if
it were not such a grim sarcasm. Oh, what a miserable
race she led me!”</p>

<p>“Misery, like joy, in wedded life, is won or lost by
the deed of two; not one. I shall not acquit my
mother; but were not there two to blame?”</p>

<p>“Two? no; only one. I could not be peaceful with
a panther.”</p>

<p>“Be not too severe, and think a little; did not you,
after all, do much to make your wedded wife what she
was at her worst?”</p>

<p>“What, I? Thou dost not think that?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I know the story of your espousal; your
flight from Gerash, and then your after conflicts. You
knew before you determined against all opposing, in
the face of reasons most grave, and without any thought
of your adaptation to each other, to wed, that your
tempers, tastes, and trainings were in almost every
thing apart.”</p>

<p>“Well, we loved each other sincerely; our marriage
vows were honestly taken.”</p>

<p>“Marriage; that settled it forever! Did you as
honestly keep as you took the vows, for better or
worse?”</p>

<p>“Now that were impossible. Did you ever see your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
mother in rage, her muscles rising in a sort of serpentine
wavings from her feet upward? Ugh! I hear
her sibilant, hissing words of scorn, now. They’ll haunt
me forever. She was a lotus in love, and a boa in
wrath.”</p>

<p>“I may have seen her so, but out on the love that
lets such visions displace memories of the best things;
a daughter, nurtured by her, can not; a husband sworn
on hymen’s altar, dare not forget.”</p>

<p>“I tried to set her right, Miriamne.”</p>

<p>“Not always with kindness unfailing. I’ve seen the
scourge-marks on her heart. I’ve heard her moan as
a wounded dove; no, more piteously, as a deserted wife
and mother. You tried to set her right by forcing her
to your faith, that, too, when the girl-wife was weak
and exhausted by early maternity. You have been
wont ever to pity profoundly the holy mother who recoiled
fainting from the spectacle of her son scourged
to crucifixion. That pity is a fine feeling; but since
Mary’s day is passed, it is finer to evince a manly tenderness
for living women moving toward their Calvary.
How you waste your emotions on the dead! Mary
Hyacinthus, Ichabod, have all, Rizpah nothing.”</p>

<p>“See here, daughter; let me look down into thy eyes.
I’m of a mind to think the sun has gotten into thy
brain. It gets into every body’s in this country.” So
saying, he turned her face toward his own. It was a
bungling effort on his part to parry her thrusts with
ridicule, the last weapon of the defeated.</p>

<p>She was a little indignant, but yet too earnest to be
diverted, and so followed up her advantage.</p>

<p>“You were the stronger, every way, and fenced well
against your other self. The woman erred, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
grievously, perhaps, and you had your sweet retaliations.
How sweet you can tell. Each blow at her, fell
on me, my brothers and yourself. Oh, it’s the climax-revenge
to lay open with giant thrusts, monstrous and
keen, vein and nerve. One may mar a good purpose
by pursuing it cruelly. Were not your efforts to set
my mother right severe, sometimes?”</p>

<p>“Did the eloquent Hospitaler put these fine words
together for thee, girl?” testily questioned Sir Charleroy.</p>

<p>“No matter who sent them, if they be true words.
If you get angry, I’ll be wounded. You need not try
hard to hurt me. I will strive to be all filial, while all
loyal; but not more so to father than to mother.”</p>

<p>“Well, but she was a rheumatism to me.”</p>

<p>“So be it; still she was part of you. Does one dismember
a limb that aches, or give it tenderer care than
all others?”</p>

<p>“‘It is better,’ said Solomon, ‘to dwell in the wilderness,
than with a contentious and angry woman.’ I
got heartily weary of an ache that ached because it
ached.”</p>

<p>“I’ll place Joseph by Solomon.”</p>

<p>“Pray, how?”</p>

<p>“He espoused Mary and was with her, yet apart;
thus showing God’s idea of the needs of weary mothers
in their trying hours, when giving their strength to
another being. Joseph was kept as a lover only, until
after Jesus was born, that his services might have a
lover’s tenderness. I have heard that the manhood of
Jesus reflected the sweetness of Mary; Joseph kept his
wife in those days sweet, so the kindness of that noble
spouse lived after all, an immortal influence. Joseph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
through Mary in part, determined the bodily traits of
the child Jesus; the latter influences all time.”</p>

<p>“Why, truly, thou hast found a beautiful flower,
Miriamne, and I’m wondering that I never saw it before
in Mary’s life. But, finally, I tell thee I loved
Rizpah as my soul at first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; you both loved with almost volcanic ardor.
My mother told me so; but this very power and
inclination of passionate loving gave you each for the
other power of dreadfully hurting.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll speak further of this, perhaps, another
time. The hyacinth lures me to Ichabod’s tomb.”</p>

<p>“The rose, emblem of Mary, flower of wedded love,
is sweeter than the hyacinth. Go home to Bozrah,
father, I beseech you, so you may prove yourself still
a Knight of Saint Mary.”</p>

<p>“Home? I’ve none! Bozrah is grim ruins within,
without. There, as only fit and in fit dwellings, abide
the cormorant and hyena. All hopes that ever centred
in that place for me were but dancing satyrs at the
last; all loves but eagles with hot-iron beaks, which
devoured the hearts that fed them, then fled away! I
hate Bozrah!”</p>

<p>“You have a wife and children there. I a mother.
Where the brood is, there is home. Bozrah has no
gloom for us, save such as we make for it. It may
be a glad place yet. Remember that Kidron and Golgotha
were made all beautiful by the fidelity of Mary
and the cross-bearing of Jesus.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne, this parley is useless. Once for all, hear
me. Before I wed thy mother I took upon my soul
an impious, almost desperate, vow, that I’d possess
her though the possessing ruined me. The strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
hopeful Knight of the Cross was domineered over by
his love. Before this I had some commendable principles
and a little piety. What am I now, after long
driftings about through wasted years of prime? I’m
the wreck of a man; less! a part of a wreck, trying to
get made over in a meaner pattern out of the fragments
left. Thy mother unmade me!”</p>

<p>“Adam said something like that of Eve.”</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt me, Miriamne. The Jewish maiden
Zainab gave Mohammed, of Bozrah, the poisoned lamp
which ruined his health; the Jewish Rizpah has such a
lamp. See me, wrinkled, hair whitened, all too soon;
chivalry, morality and piety dragged out of me bit by
bit. I stand here the caricature of what I was or what
I should be. I’m fit for neither war nor courtship.
I’d make a pretty show attempting to court Rizpah!
I’ve forgotten how such things are done, and, besides,
I’m not the original Sir Charleroy she wed. Let her
find him, or his counterfeit, and be happy. The original
Sir Charleroy and Rizpah loved each other desperately,
but these that I know hate each other as desperately.
I tell thee it would be legalized adultery for
these latter two to live under the same roof, pleading as
justification the vows of the other two! Miriamne, I tell
thee that thou mayst tell it on the house tops, or hill tops,
as I’ll cry it through eternity, if permitted, Sir Charleroy
and Rizpah, of Gerash and Bozrah, died long ago! The
devil stole their bodies, put an imp’s spirit in each, and
then parted them forever. If they ever meet it will
be by the fiend’s device, that he may revel over their
warrings with each other! Ah, ha! What the Roman
arena was to the blood-thirsty populace, such to the
fiends the homes of the world when full of tumults!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>And Miriamne, alarmed by the outbreak, tried to
calm her father:</p>

<p>“Oh, father, you will need mercy some day; merit
it by bestowing it. You suffer an unforgiving spirit to
inflame your passion!”</p>

<p>“Forgiving? What’s the use? I’ve vainly tried
mercy!”</p>

<p>“Try once more. The injured have resource so long
as they have power to forgive. Remember Him who
in the great extremity cried: ‘<i>They know not what
they do!</i>’ Trust Rizpah once more!”</p>

<p>“I do not see the shadow of a peg on which to hang
a trust.”</p>

<p>“You, a Teutonic Knight of St. Mary!”</p>

<p>“Thank God Mary was not a Rizpah!”</p>

<p>“Mary had the trust of Joseph in those dire days,
when nothing but a miracle could prove her integrity.
She presents not only woman’s goodness but that which
even the loftiest wife needs, the constancy beyond
measure of her husband.”</p>

<p>“Joseph was advised by an angel. I not.”</p>

<p>“As you love your mother, honor the woman who
mothers your children. They bear your image, yet she
alone, with a sublime self-forgetting, struggles to have
them grow up honorably, purely, and in the fear of God.”</p>

<p>“She wants to make them Israelites.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, and perhaps the Christian examples
she has seen give her no reason to wish otherwise. But
after all, her way is better than to have left them as
their father left them, to become infidels or nothing.
Oh, father, do not think me bold. I speak because I
love you; as perhaps no other might care or presume
to give utterance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, girl, I guess I’m a double man; for, determined
to oppose, I feel a desire within to have thee
win in this argument. I’m one compound of contradictions.
I was a sworn bachelor, then a sworn husband,
now I’m neither. I’m a widower, with a living wife;
a parent of three children with only one. I bewail my
homelessness, yet run from an offered home. I confess
to being useless, yet see a mission most important at
my own door. Swearing loyalty to Mary, I disregard
all she exemplified—of late revealed to me; professing
to be a Christian, I live a life that would shame a decent
Jew. I have a daughter, said by all to be much like
me in temper, feature, and mind, yet we are here utterly
opposed in thought and purpose. I’ve heard the profoundest
teachers in grandest temples unmoved to this
duty, to-day presented; and, now, without the pale of
any church, in the wilds of Jericho, a mere girl, my
daughter, instructs me well! This all proves that I’m
the caricature of Miriamne’s father. If I be Sir Charleroy,
then I’m beside myself!”</p>

<p>“A good half confession! Now for the atonement!”</p>

<p>“What, a bundle of contradictions making atonement?
undoing the past! more contradictions?”</p>

<p>“Righteousness displaces all the contradictions of
life!”</p>

<p>“I could make no atonement except by contradicting
a score of years, and going to Bozrah! Now hear
me finally; by the glory of God, alive, I’ll never go to
Rizpah’s house!”</p>

<p>Miriamne felt that further persuasion would be futile.
She made a last request, then.</p>

<p>“Will my father take me to the outskirts of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
city? I’ll enter alone to comfort the woman who,
notwithstanding her faults, I believe to be the noblest
of mothers. She may not have a husband; she has a
daughter.”</p>

<p>As the father and daughter rested at noon, not far
from the Giant City, some days after the foregoing
events, they beheld a single horseman from toward
Bozrah speeding along the great southern highway.</p>

<p>“I think he’s a Jew and in peaceful pursuit. I’ll
hail him,” said the knight, “in the language of Galilee.”</p>

<p>The rider, hearing the call, halted. Glancing about
him he discovered the source of the call, and promptly
reined his steed toward where the pilgrims were sitting.
Instantly he began in short, quick sentences:</p>

<p>“Wonder; the face of a Frank, the garb of a Turk,
the voice of a Jew! An old man, a young woman! A
Moslem in company with his slave? No, she sits by
his side! A harem favorite? No! She is not veiled!
Ye do not look cunning enough for magicians, too cunning
to be pilgrims; not pious enough, old man, to be a
priest, and too pious-looking to be a robber.”</p>

<p>“True, Laconic,” said the knight, “I’m at no loss as
to thee.”</p>

<p>“So it seems! But pray, Christian, Jewish, Druses,
Turks, who are ye?”</p>

<p>“We’re pilgrims, good runner.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha; these pilgrims are a mad-lot, with piebald
customs!”</p>

<p>“What news, runner?”</p>

<p>“What news! A plague in Bozrah! De Griffin’s
twins are nigh to death—De Griffin? May be thou
knowest him? Thou dost look like him: but he’s dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
Now his twins have no nurses nor mourners, but Rizpah,
and I’m racing to Gerash to see if I can find a soul
to swell her wailings.”</p>

<p>The rider turned his horse and with a word, “<i>Selamet</i>,”—“peace,”
was gone.</p>

<p>Miriamne had heard enough, and now, with redoubled
vehemence, reöpened her arguments and appeals
to her father to go to her home.</p>

<p>“I’ll not go into Rizpah’s house. I tell thee thou
art inviting me into hell!”</p>

<p>Miriamne, in turn, replied: “There is good anywhere
for those that earnestly seek it. Mohammed,
they say, got his first inspiration in Bozrah, and he a
Moslem, a crescent devotee!”</p>

<p>“Yes; he wed a rich wife there, too, and she was a
saint. I may envy him in these things.”</p>

<p>The young woman hastily entered the city and
stopped for a little time at the mission house of Father
Adolphus, briefly, hurriedly, to announce her return,
inquire the latest report concerning the illness of her
brothers, and to beseech the old priest to go out after
her father; if possible, to bring him into the city and
to the desolate fireside.</p>

<p>“Well, well; there, now, I’d call thee bee or humming-bird,
truly, darting from point to point, subject to
subject, if I didn’t know I was talking to an angel.”</p>

<p>The sincere compliment was unheard by Miriamne,
for she was gone ere it was sounded. The old man
shaded his eyes, looked after her a few moments, then
girding himself, hobbled down the street to seek at the
city’s outskirt the waiting knight.</p>

<p>And Miriamne, with heart beating high, sped on
homeward. But as she approached it she slackened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
her pace, with questionings as to how she had best enter,
so as to secure loving welcome and in no wise perturb
by sudden surprise. She saw her mother through
the doorway, bowed and swinging back and forth. The
girl’s heart divined all; “My brothers are dead!” The
mother seemed oblivious to all about her, and Miriamne
hesitated on the threshold. Just then the runner
galloped up to the open door, reined his steed, and exclaimed:
“Out of sight, out of mind! Death, like
poverty, sifts our friends! Ye can hire mourners
cheaper at Bozrah than at Gerash, and there are none
to be had without coins! Gerash is distant. I had no
coins, and was a fool to start, wise to return!” It was
Laconic, and he was gone before any reply was given.
Rizpah didn’t even lift up her head to notice his coming
or going.</p>

<p>Miriamne was glad of the circumstance, for the
runner gave her words with which to enter: “A daughter
never forsakes.” She spoke thus, very softly.</p>

<p>Rizpah, perhaps not recognizing the voice, moaned
on, swaying as she moaned:</p>

<p>“Mother, mother?”</p>

<p>Rizpah slowly lifted her eyes to the speaker; then,
either by a masterful self-control or because sorrow
dazed, she slowly and without emotion, addressed the
maiden:</p>

<p>“Thou here? So, then, my three are safe together,
before my eyes, in death. Thou wert buried years
ago.”</p>

<p>Without another word the daughter and sister
quietly moved to the forms lying beside the mother,
and knelt down, bowing, her one arm flung over the
corses. Presently she reached out her hand and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
met a warm clasp from her mother. The maiden knew
full well that it meant welcome. It was death’s victory;
expressive, unspoken eloquence. There were
four hearts; two still in death; two alive and breaking,
but the dead hearts somehow drew the living ones
together and then they beat as one, each all comforting
to the other. Two dead hearts bridged the gulf
between two living ones. There followed the embrace
and kiss of peace, and then Rizpah questioned:</p>

<p>“Wilt stay with me a little while, my only—?” thereupon
she sobbed and was relieved.</p>

<p>“Stay? Yes, always! But when, the burial?”</p>

<p>“At once! It’s the plague and the law requires
promptness. O Death, thou didst do thy bitterest for
Rizpah!”</p>

<p>Rizpah soon rose up and began to busy herself about
the bodies.</p>

<p>“Mother, tell me how to aid you.”</p>

<p>“Yea, as I need. Thou and I wilt carry them to
the cave of entombment.”</p>

<p>“But will there be no funeral rites?”</p>

<p>“I’ll perform such; keeping vigil as Rizpah of old.
My children were crucified, as were hers. All mankind
turned from us in our stress, and so they died in
want.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, the watching would kill you!”</p>

<p>“Thou dost comfort me, now. Oh, I’d be overjoyed,
if I only knew for certainty that death would
court me at my vigil.”</p>

<p>Softly Miriamne spoke:</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy is at Bozrah.”</p>

<p>“Now thou makest Bozrah seem afar. Oh, the
garments of people may brush together passing, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
still to all things else the passers be eternities apart,”
replied quickly, and yet with cool self-possession,
Rizpah.</p>

<p>“Death, that cools the pulses, also subdues the
asperities. I could not hate an enemy if I met him
amid his dead,” persuasively responded the maiden.</p>

<p>“Imperious, fanatical, stubborn Charleroy! changeable
in all but his determination to make conquest of
the faith of others. Then, I can not ask his pardon
for my serving God. Liberty came to Egypt because
the mothers of captive Israel were faithful. So says
our Talmud.”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy respects at least, fidelity.”</p>

<p>“Then ’tis well to have me die. He never did me
justice to my face; let him embalm me in honey after
I’m dead, as Herod did the wife he murdered. It’s a
way of some husbands. But we must be moving,
daughter; I’ve prepared two biers. The plague is a
stern messenger, nor leaves room for any dallying.”</p>

<p>And Bozrah witnessed a strange, sad spectacle. Two
roughly constructed burial couches; on each a body,
and two women, the one aged, the other youthful, both
bowed with grief, slowly bearing the biers away, down
to the tomb-hill. The elder directed; and so they
went; first a little way forward with one body, then
returning to advance the other. There were no
mourners following; the passers-by offered no help;
the women of the city drew their doors shut, and the
children playing in the streets, when they beheld this
funeral procession, fled away with subdued exclamations.</p>

<p>The ancient Rizpah, watching her dead on their
crosses, was standing that time in her valley of “dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
bones;” her imitator, Rizpah de Griffin, was now
walking through that same valley. Both made pitiable
by desolation. Neither was able to hide her dead from
her sight by looking for the hope of the blessed resurrection.
Their loving had been fierce enough, but the
soul-reviving Spirit of the prophet’s vision was not yet
seen to be in the valley for them. The two Rizpahs were
“mothers of sorrow,” but followed no cross that had
on it besides “death,” “victory.” They went with
tears, but not held by a love that triumphs in “leading
captivity captive.” These ancient Jewish mothers
may be put in striking contrast with the Davidic Queen
Mary, who wept from the Judgment Hall, past the
cross, past the tomb, up to the chamber of Pentecost,
from which she viewed the transports of the Ascension
of her Son, her Saviour, her King.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Teutonic knight was standing in silent
contemplation of a pile of ruins, from the
center of which rose a number of stately
columns like so many mourners about a
grave. These were all left of a stately old temple.
Art had done nobly here once; now desolation was
master, even the name of the structure being forgotten.
The priest approached, questioning within himself
as to how he would address Sir Charleroy, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
they met. As he drew nearer, he thought here are two
temples in decay. There came to his mind out of the
distant past a vision of Sir Charleroy as he was when
he stood erect, ruddy-cheeked and every wit a man by
his bride’s side, the time of the wedding at Damascus.
The priest, contrasting the man before him, now aged
and solemn faced, with what he was then, thought “of
the two ruined temples, the man is the sadder one. A
quarter of a century slipping over a life, though with
noiseless feet, generally leaves its tracks; if pain and
passion have been the companion of the years, havoc
is wrought.” Solemnly, and in measured tones, the
priest’s meditations having given him free utterance,
he spoke, quoting the words long before sadly pronounced
by the Savior concerning Jerusalem’s holy
place: “<i>Destroy this temple and in three days I will
raise it up.</i>”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy slowly, very slowly, turning his eyes
upon the speaker, observed him from head to foot, but
uttered not a word.</p>

<p>Again the priest spoke: “Time has so changed both
knight and priest, that they forget themselves; nor is
it therefore wonderful, they should not remember each
other.”</p>

<p>“Father Adolphus! Miriamne’s work?”</p>

<p>“What matter whose act if we see God back of the
actor. I’ve a message from on high!”</p>

<p>“Why, thou dost astound me!”</p>

<p>“Methinks no man more needs astounding. May
righteousness enter the gates opened by wonder, and
so move thee into Rizpah’s home and thine; death is
there!”</p>

<p>“Is there? has been! When love was slain, I shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
out its bleeding form with the mourning robes of a
long forgetfulness.</p>

<p>“There are hopes that die to live no more; so there
are homes which bereft of their household Penates are
doomed to grim ruin forever. See these giant dwellings.
They tell it all.</p>

<p>“Thou art a Christian, I believe; but like the disciples,
Cleopas and Luke, with eyes holden; not discerning
the Lord.</p>

<p>“Just as some, having embalmed the body, looked
into the tomb at a napkin only, seeing merely the
place where He lay. Though puzzled that the grave’s
seal was broken, they were still blind to the miracle of
a new dawn, simultaneous with the unclasping of
night’s grim arms. They had heard of the resurrection
to be, yet they reasoned that the Promiser was surely
dead. Love alone, in the person of Mary Magdalene,
most loving because most forgiven, overleaped all
doubts, disappointments and fears, to hie away in the
thinning darkness, in an utter abandonment to her
trust in the words of Him, to whom her heart was
given. That was love indeed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, priest, ’tis so. A woman; a woman; leading
in religion! I do not much bepraise her, for she, being
a woman, easily could believe, where men
doubted.”</p>

<p>“It would have been cruel to have crossed her faith,
would it not, Sir Charleroy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, on my soul, yes!”</p>

<p>“Then go to the bier of thy boys. Let love overleap
all obstacles.”</p>

<p>“But let me rest, priest. I’ve had the full draught
of trouble’s cup. I’m quit of further conflict.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thou believest? Listen:</p>

<p>“To whom also he shewed himself alive after His
passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them
forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to
the kingdom of God——</p>

<p>“Christian Cross-bearing knight, hear me! The
suffering Savior could never have revealed Himself,
as the Almighty, Risen Christ, if there had been no
cross. By what He suffered He had gain of power.
Thy wrinkles, disciplines and all such like, fit thee now
to minister in the chamber of death; even where now
of all places on earth, thou art needed.”</p>

<p>“But my case is so peculiar, my home so unnatural!”</p>

<p>“Is there no balm in Gilead, Sir Charleroy? If
thou and she have been great sinners, He’s a great Savior,
and more, a patient one. Hast thou thought
how He lingered near His followers in an overplus of
love, lured from the triumphs of heaven, to personally
deal, all comfortingly, all encouragingly, peculiarly
with individuals? For thirty-three years in the flesh
he wandered about, doing good, healing all those oppressed
of the devil; but the finest hours of all His
life lay in those forty days between the resurrection
and the ascension. Well might He say to Mary:
‘Touch me not,’ when in love, she fain would have
retarded Him by sentimental fondling. Listen now:</p>

<p>“‘I have not yet ascended: Go to my disciples, say
to them: I ascend unto my Father and your Father,
to my God and your God!’ He was making a sublime
accent along golden steps, and the number of those
steps were ten and two, even as the number of Israel’s
tribes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not comprehend this mysticism, though the
word-frame is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Then know it. On the cross, Immanuel cried: ‘It
is finished!’ Glorious salvation’s work was finished;
but then He lingered still to bless, especially His
friends. Count the steps. He appeared first to Mary
Magdalene, out of whom he had cast the seven devils
and who doubtless clung to the Savior, her only hope,
her only deliverance from the awful realities of the tragedy
in her soul. Thy Rizpah was never so ill as Magdalene,
yet surely she is worthy as much tenderness.”</p>

<p>“Secondly. Jesus appeared to His mother; love’s appearing.
I see her now, in mind, by the record here
unnamed—left in the sacred privacy of her grief; too
stricken to minister, but close to the triumph, because
all needful of its blessing. I see a third step—Jesus,
by special appointment, meeting the backsliding fisherman
of Tiberias, now gone away to his nets, persuading
himself he had done and suffered enough, even
as does Sir Charleroy to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been called Pilate. Go on. Call me Peter; I
can bear it.”</p>

<p>“Fourthly. The Christ joined Luke and Cleopas, the
Greek proselytes, now doubters; but the chill of their
misgivings was burned away in hearts inflamed, while
they journeyed to Emmaus.”</p>

<p>“Now call me Luke-Cleopas, priest. I’ve the chill
of the doubts, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Fifthly. He came to His own little church-of-the-upper-room,
to breathe on it peace and to display His
all-convincing body; then He waited a week for a
special unfoldment to Thomas, the all-doubter, leaving
him filled with all faith.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that He’d come to Sir Charleroy!” said the
knight.</p>

<p>“He does, but the knight’s eyes are holden, and he
starves while toiling for fish in a dead sea. Listen to
these words by the shore of Tiberias:</p>

<p>“‘Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye
any meat? They answered him, No.</p>

<p>“‘And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right
side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore,
and now they were not able to draw it for the
multitude of fishes.</p>

<p>“‘Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none
of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing
that it was the Lord.</p>

<p>“‘Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth
them, and fish likewise.’</p>

<p>“Oh, Sir Charleroy, cast in the net on the right side,
then come and dine.”</p>

<p>“But I’m an odd man; not like others.”</p>

<p>“He that is All Fullness later appeared to multitudes
of every clime, the representatives of the Church
universal, ever full of odd people; again to the apostle
of good works, James, called the pillar of faith. The
tenth appearing was at Bethany, as the blesser and
promiser to all. After that he showed himself to Paul,
proof that he was a returning Christ, and, last of all,
to John on Patmos. This the John that was care-taker
of Mary, the mother; John, the all-loving. I read each
page of the glowing Apocalypse as a love-letter from
heaven to a mother, from a Son who carries eternally
within His glorious heart the image of the woman
great chiefly for her great love of Him. She loyally
followed Him to the grave; He lovingly followed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
beyond it. When he set John to picturing heaven as
a virgin-bride and His Church as a woman clothed
with the sun, Christ had surely the choicest of women,
Mary, in His heart.”</p>

<p>“And the Heart of Heaven might well lovingly remember
the mystical Rose,” quoth the knight.</p>

<p>“As heaven loved Mary, so should noble men love
‘bone of their bone, flesh of their flesh,’ <i>as Christ
loved the Church and gave Himself for it</i>.”</p>

<p>“Thou wert never wed, good priest?”</p>

<p>“No; perhaps ’tis well so. I’ve had a work in helping
those who were wed unhappily, to peace; forgetting,
in serving their need, my own joy.”</p>

<p>“Then thou hast no idea of what it is to deal with
a Rizpah as a wife.”</p>

<p>“I know she’s a woman; a marvel in her fidelity to
her children. She may have infirmities, but there was
a woman, bowed grievously for eighteen years, fully restored
by one kind touch of the man, Jesus, ever all-pitiful
and tender toward women.”</p>

<p>“But that one was willing to be healed.”</p>

<p>“No; she was trying to hide, but the Savior called
her out, just to heal her.”</p>

<p>“Now, then, let me cross swords at close quarters,
since thou dost press me. I ask thee, as a Christian
priest, wouldst thou have me tolerate the sins of
heresy in my own home? Remember, Jezebel, she beguiled
Ahab, her daughter, Athaliah, and her husband,
Jehoram, also, into gravest transgressions. So
God’s people were led, little by little, to the groves of
Astarte. I think I’ve a good parallel: Jezebel was the
daughter of a priest, so this Rizpah of Bozrah. With
her hot temper, pride of exalted birth, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
mouthful of arguments; a man meets such a woman
as a pigmy, to crouch, or as a knight, to resist.”</p>

<p>“The name Jezebel means ‘chaste.’ Her pious
namers must have respected chastity once. Her practices
were all loyalty to Ahab and her children, though
her theories may have been odious. All that is recorded
of them, which engenders hate for her memory,
is the hatefulness of the way she pressed her
creeds upon others, the Jews. Which the more like
Jezebel—Sir Charleroy or Rizpah?”</p>

<p>“But Rizpah was ardent to lay our love, and our
children on her altar. Like the women who brought
their jewels to Aaron to be transmuted into the golden
calf! I could only protest, and I did.”</p>

<p>“Did not the men of Egypt and Israel first proclaim
the worship of Apis? Were not the women merely
following their lords? There are many women who
defile their jewels because, with contempts that turn
their hearts to ashes, their lords do not, as they
should, wear both the wives and the jewels on strong
and loyal hearts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I perceive! Rizpah has been parading to thee
her family troubles. A true woman would have rather
given herself to nest-hiding.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast not hidden thy nest, but, like a wandering
bird, fled it.”</p>

<p>“She never asked my aid; she left me in London.”</p>

<p>The knight was charging blindly, and defeated.</p>

<p>“It was not for her to crave, but for thee to lavishly
bestow. She left thee? What better could Abigail have
done than turn her beautiful countenance and good understanding
away from churlish Nabal, who lived chiefly
to gloat about the cross on which he had placed her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does the sacrist advocate divorce?”</p>

<p>“No! No rupture of the tie sealed in heaven; but
when by recriminations a home becomes a living
burial, a hell, then two houses are better than one. I
feel here keenly, knight. My mother had a monstrous
man, my father, in wedlock. He left her to battle
single-handed for her little ones. Her patient, sad
face comes ever before me. Oh, how she eschewed all
other men, though courted by worthier than he; how
she strove to hide my father’s faults and taught us, his
children, to try to respect him! I was but a youth
when he died, but I tell thee I dared not look upon his
coffined face lest I should curse him, then and there!”</p>

<p>The knight cowered as if from a malediction.</p>

<p>“There, there! for heaven’s sake pause, Sacrist!
Abashed at home, lashed by the teacher of the faith
I’ve suffered to defend, I’ll be driven to flee to the
wandering Bedouin, or to death!”</p>

<p>“They say Lucifer, unable to commit suicide, plunges
headlong into the abyss when thwarted in any design.”</p>

<p>“Call me Lucifer; another epithet!”</p>

<p>“There are no black gulfs into which thou canst flee
from the memories which conscience points to when
duty is contemned.”</p>

<p>“Is it the priest’s purpose to harass my soul?”</p>

<p>“No; but rather to lead it back to its peace that
thou didst leave long ago. There is only one way of return,
that a very <i>Via Dolorosa</i>. Mary along it walked
with her son, her God and Savior, to the cross and the
resurrection! By the cross God gives, we go to our
glory.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried my best to be a loyal, Christian knight.
Give me, at least, that award.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can not praise justly; I dare not flatter; I must
in all faithfulness say thou hast yet to learn the alphabet
of loyalty, as interpreted by that glorious pair,
Mary and the Christ—the triumphant Eve, the triumphant
Adam. Thou hast been following afar off,
nearer the flickering of Judas’ illusive lantern than to
Him who pleaded amid His griefs, all self-forgetting,
with His Roman guards to let His little band of followers
depart unharmed. The woman whom thou exaltest
as the queen of hearts is, after all, not thy
pattern. Judas and Mary are in lasting contrast; he
all treason, she fidelity’s choicest fruit. It is well
to see to it to which one is the nearer. Oh, Gethsemane,
garden of touching contrasts! There love
was most grossly interpreted by the shrines of <i>Baaltis</i>;
there most grandly interpreted by love’s sublimest
offering that night the Saviour agonized. There
twice the enemy of man did his almost worst; once
by the rites of the groves, once in the wracking temptations
of the Man of Sorrows. The arch-fiend was
baffled, and then the ingenuity of hell was taxed to
one last, most terrific and dastardly assault. What
thinkest thou was the climax? The last effort to blot
out the hope of man was made through betrayal by a
kiss; the finest sign of affection befouled by treason!
When the wedded betray each other, alas, for the
world!”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy surrendered now, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Oh, Father Adolphus; again I see there is a mist
on my knightly cross! I’m unworthy to wear the sign.
It has been an emblem of death; I see it now an emblem
of life and love.”</p>

<p>“Will the knight look on the dead faces of his sons?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes! In the name of God, yes! Lead me as
a child, for I’m nothing more.”</p>

<p>The knight was in the throes of transformation.
He and the priest walked side by side, mostly in
silence, broken anon, only by questions of Sir Charleroy’s,
like these:</p>

<p>“Am I worth saving? Shall I ever become able to
fully sound and truly express, in life, the depths of all
thou hast told me? And Rizpah! what will Rizpah
say or do?”</p>

<p>The old priest answered ever:</p>

<p>“‘Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead, and Christ Himself shall give thee light!’”</p>

<p>The lone burial cave was reached. Nigh the two
biers stood Rizpah and Miriamne and but a little way
off Sir Charleroy and the priest. The maiden, with
surprised joy, saw the two men, but Rizpah, busy with
her thoughts, never lifted her eyes. The latter drew a
slab away from the entrance of the tomb and then
moaned: “Better I’d never been a mother.”</p>

<p>Father Adolphus seized the opportunity to say in
deep, entreating tones:</p>

<p>“‘I will ransom them from the power of the grave:
I will redeem them from death.’”</p>

<p>The mother supposing it was some kindly neighbor,
still unnoticing any thing but the speaker’s voice,
moaned on, sitting nigh the tomb-door, between the
dead, a hand on each.</p>

<p>Then the old shepherd drew nearer, saying:</p>

<p>“Sisters of Israel, only believe. Beyond this stony
gate there is an eternal home fairer than any dream.
There all broken homes shall rise in joy, their treasures
reunited and happy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Rizpah rose, and observing the speaker silently
for a moment, she did not seem offended at the priest’s
presence. Misery had overcome, at least for the time,
her prejudice. Presently she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My family reunited in heaven? Ah! that can not
be, and if it were so, what joy to ever repeat the bickering,
blamings and wrongs of this poor miserable life?”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt know as thou art known there and see
eye to eye,” said the missioner.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it could be only so!”</p>

<p>“Wouldst like it so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the grave of my darlings, I swear it! I
loved them with my life madly. All the love I had
was concentrated in them. I knew when I began idolizing
them that I had loved before full well my husband
and daughter. I knew this, because the love I
withdrew from them rushed forth to the boys. But my
idols are dead, and now if my love do not dry up,
it will hunger, feed on me myself, then turn to ferocity
wolf-like.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps a husband restored may fill and enlarge
thy heart. There never was a great sorrow but there
stood near it a great joy,” spoke the priest.</p>

<p>“Ah, he is stubborn, I, perhaps, proud. Immensity
is between me and Sir Charleroy.”</p>

<p>“Hast thou not yet had enough of pride’s dead sea
apples?”</p>

<p>“Alas! why ask me?”</p>

<p>“If thou art ready for a better day, he may be.”</p>

<p>“Ready? I’ve always been. What I did for conscience
sake and these children is done. What he did
to me he only can undo, as far as the past can be
undone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Miriamne waved her hand to her father, unseen
by Rizpah, entreatingly, as if to say: “Come, but
not too quickly, a little nearer.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy complied and not as a laggard, for Rizpah
seemed changed from what she was in London.
He now saw her as in those golden early days at Gerash.
But the truth was, the change was chiefly in himself.</p>

<p>“Rizpah!”</p>

<p>“Sir Charleroy de Griffin!” replied the woman addressed
deliberately, and apparently emotionlessly, as
she fixed her eyes upon the knight. Then her eyes
turned toward the tomb, seemingly inviting his to follow
there their course. She stepped back and glanced
from man to tomb, by the glance saying more plainly
than words:</p>

<p>“That is thy work. Thou didst open that grave in
my pathway.”</p>

<p>The knight stood by her side and put forth his hand
to clasp hers, but with a respectfulness that betokened
the cavalier and one not quite certain of his welcome.</p>

<p>Then spake Father Adolphus:</p>

<p>“Remember Damascus, both of you. Come, Miriamne,”
he continued, drawing the maiden aside, “I’ve
a giant’s grave to show thee.”</p>

<p>The priest and the maiden moved to a turn in the
road and passed behind the crumbled wall of a Roman
palace.</p>

<p>“But, Father Adolphus, where now? What of the
giant’s grave?”</p>

<p>“Be content, girl. I mean the grave of mad love
grown to mad hate. It will be made and deep enough
by thy parents, but they can best make it alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>And Miriamne fell upon her knees in silent, grateful
prayer; a great burden that had borne her down for
years seemed lifted from off her. The Miserere that
had wailed through her life so long now changed to an
Easter anthem.</p>

<p>Father Adolphus after a time recalled her by a single
question:</p>

<p>“Dost see the fierce woman and the vultures fleeing
away before the coming of our Christian Mother of
Sorrows?”</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">There had come a great change to the home
of the De Griffins at Bozrah, without and
within. Shrubs and vines grew about the
old stone house in profusion, birds sang
contentedly at its casements, and kittens, undisturbed,
played around its doors. These were tokens of the new
inner life.</p>

<p>The queen of that domestic palace was happy; its
king restored to his rights and duties; therefore there
was abounding delight and peace within and without.
Sir Charleroy and Rizpah, the two mature wed-lovers
that abode there, had, out of all their estrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
and tribulations, come to understand at last that love
grows out of law and is more than a sentiment, free to
go when lured or flee from that which burdens. It was
to them like a revelation from heaven to find that love
is the vassal of the will and can be made to go where
it ought, as well as be reined back from lawless rovings.
They found there was great satisfaction in their efforts
to be very agreeable to each other. Sir Charleroy constantly
assured Rizpah of his belief that they were now
more really lovers than they had been in those fervent
days at Gerash. She believed this new creed with the
avidity of a heart sore with long waitings for its proclaiming.</p>

<p>The knight bethought himself of a graceful advance,
and introduced the matter with a sort of parable. “I’ve
been thinking to-day that the only man whom I ever
felt like kissing, the man who loved me to the full of
his great heart, is present with us in spirit these days
to joy over our reconciliation. I’ve felt a strange thrill
at times which made me think I was touched by the
glowing heart of Ichabod.”</p>

<p>“Ichabod?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he that fell in our defense the day of that
perilous battle with those Mamelukes, near Gerash.
Ah, he had the heart of a mastiff, the soul of a
martyr!”</p>

<p>“Thy love is constant. But what’s in thy hand?”</p>

<p>The knight had hoped for the question.</p>

<p>“A token I took from his corpse. It was given him
by a Copt priest, whose life he saved in Egypt. See.”</p>

<p>“I see a stone in a gold setting; on the stone an
image, I think of a woman? I’ve noticed it with thee
before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>“I knew it! Once I thought thou didst observe it
askance, as if a trifle jealous. Well, no more secrets,
no more jealousies. What says Rizpah?”</p>

<p>“I say amen; and yet I say tell all, or none; either
way I shall be content. Love’s trust, when full, has
few questions and no doubts.”</p>

<p>“Nobly spoken, but yet I must tell all. The image
is of <i>Neb-ta</i>, from the country of Hamites.”</p>

<p>“What an odd figure! Her head-dress, a basket!”</p>

<p>“The basket on her head and the little house by her
side betoken that she was the presiding spirit of domestic
life. I love Neb-ta! She ever reminds me of
woman at her best, as a mother brooding her chicks.”</p>

<p>“Praise be the Patriarchs; they left us testimonies
which makes it needless to go to Egypt for precepts
concerning home-love!” responded the wife.</p>

<p>“But, Rizpah, thou dost divert me! Wait; I’m
coming around with the patriarchs, by way of Jerusalem,
to Bozrah.”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s a fine parade; I await it,” the woman,
with quick reply, answered.</p>

<p>“Tradition says this Neb-ta will stand before Osiris
and Isis in the judgment ‘hall of truth,’ where another
deity styled ‘divine wisdom’ opens the books of men’s
earthly deeds. As the great Anubis weighs them,
Neb-ta stands by ready to cut away the failings of
those weighed. When the scale of their merit is lacking,
she herself leaps into it, to weigh it down in their
behalf.”</p>

<p>“A pretty myth for grim old Nile Land!”</p>

<p>“It proves man’s belief that at last he’ll need help.”</p>

<p>“It is strange those women degraders should have
allotted one of that sex so fine a part in the hereafter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>“It illustrates the constant conviction in men’s hearts
that woman’s sympathy abides to the last.”</p>

<p>“In some men’s hearts, say. All are not equally
just.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be direct, Rizpah, and sincere. I’ve felt an indescribable
unworthiness of all I enjoy here in the house
saved and brightened by my wife. I’ve been saying,
‘Oh, that some one like Neb-ta would cut off my failings
and enrich my merit.’”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy, after this long journey around about,
felt relieved. He had made his confession and waited
his absolution.</p>

<p>Rizpah’s eyes brightened up, and, though bedewed,
shone with the luster of gleaming affection.</p>

<p>He knew full well how to interpret that look, and
evinced the quality of the interpretation by quickly
embracing her. There passed between them salutations
having the purity of manna, the lusciousness of
Escol’s grapes.</p>

<p>“Will Sir Charleroy need to go to Egypt for a
Neb-ta?”</p>

<p>“No, never, while I’ve an all-forgiving, all-blessing
Rizpah!”</p>

<p>Encouraged by the success attending one simile, he
attempted another later:</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” tenderly replied the knight, “that
I’ve sinned against God in the name of religion, and
unconsciously offered ‘the female lamb.’”</p>

<p>“Pardon my stupidity, but yet I do not gather what
is thy meaning.”</p>

<p>“My Rizpah has been sacrificed for years.”</p>

<p>The wife tried to reply, “I’m no lamb without
blemish;” but her tears and his passionate embrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
checked her utterance. To those without, there is
much incomprehensible in the estrangements and reconciliations
of human pairs, made utterly one in wedlock.
If, since the Incarnate died for love, and the
Temple’s veil was rent, there has been on earth an unrevealed
Holiest of Holy places, it has been where wed
lives, alienated, have been reunited. It is like a sacrilege
to attempt its depicting to stranger eyes or ears.
Many, for themselves, have been within that holy place;
each twain meeting its own peculiar and varied experiences.
But, having come forth with a natural and
most meritorious reverence for the events of such supreme
hours, they are wont to withdraw from human
curiosity all that transpired, as completely as they hide
from the world their souls’ dealings with God. They
who have never been within that Holy Place, can not
understand about what there transpires; those that
have been there, defend their sacred right to keep from
all the world that which they saw and felt, by refusing
to give audience to the experiences of others.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy and Rizpah, at the time of the foregoing
conversation, entered serenely, lovingly that Holy
Place. Then they took, as it were, wings of memory
and shields of faith. The grim giant house was forgotten.
Its walls seemed to thin away, until they had to
themselves a broad, but secluded world. There was
light, but not exposure; repentance, mutual, and forgiveness,
not only free, but in every syllable seeming to
have balm for healing. There followed an unutterable
sense of getting nearer and nearer to each other. They
felt as if they had but one will, and that guided by
God; one mind, and that clear and heaven soaring.
The only sense of being two, was in their beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
hearts, and then two hearts seemed more blessed than
one; for being two, there was the joy of their beatings
for and against each other. Words fail; it would be
sacrilege to go further. Let the curtain drop. Leave
them with a thousand angels, winged and liveried in
white, with wands of silence to keep watch and ward
until morning!</p>

<p>On the morrow they knew that both had surrendered
and both conquered. And by a paradox, to
those uninitiated, each rejoiced as much in the surrender
each had made, as in the victory which had
been won by the one defeated. Defeat and victory
was their common wealth. There was a full community
between them, and that made both rich,
whatever their possessings. Thenceforward, between
them, there was perfect frankness and consideration;
no sarcasms, no recriminations, and hence no need
of foils nor masks. Christ had captured the Crusader’s
heart, and he was now, as never before, able to reveal
the King of his soul to Rizpah. She moved unconsciously
into a beauty of character like unto that of
Mary, and her heart began singing a ‘Magnificat.’
The woman was transformed, if possible, more completely
than the man. For years amid hurtings she
had schooled herself to reticence, and had been an
enigma to all who knew her; but now, under the
rising of this new sun, she opened as the blossom of
early spring. Sir Charleroy, indeed all who knew
her, attested delight and surprise; but Rizpah was
as much surprised at herself as any other could be
at her.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know I could,” she exclaimed often with
laughter and tears. She seemed to break away and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
run from her former self as one from some phantom,
as a child from a reputed witch, or a freed
bird from a prisoning cage. She saw herself growing
in all these things every moment and exclaimed,
in the rush of feeling; “I could fly, I’m sure!” Then
tenderly, “I would not, my mate, for a thousand worlds,
unless thou couldst fly with me. No, no, Charleroy, watch
my wings; they are thine; cut them if they grow or
flutter for rising. If they do, they’ll do it themselves,
without my willing.” Again the sacredness of the
holiest came over them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rizpah, I know, I knew this wealth of love
was in thee; I’ve wondered often why I could not find
it.”</p>

<p>“I did not know it, my lover king; I’m glad thou
hast found it, for thy finding feeds me with light and
glory! I’m carried back to Gerash and Damascus.”</p>

<p>“I think not. There were flaming swords at Eden’s
Gate, after the fall. No going back; but the swords
gave light for departure into broader places. I think
that’s the symbol of the sword and the flame, Rizpah.”
Again he spoke: “Hadrian built a temple of Venus
over the tomb of Christ, but Hadrian and Venus are
no more in power and there has been a resurrection
from that tomb.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sir Charleroy, I’m a child in thy creed, but I’m
comforted by thy resurrection hopes, especially since
conversing yesterday more freely than ever with our
lovely child of God, Miriamne.”</p>

<p>“Hers is an angel’s visit, wife.”</p>

<p>“And angel-like, with filial spirit, she comes, this
time, with request for our consent to an act of great
import to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>“So; and what may it be? Though I know it can
only be good.”</p>

<p>“She came to tell us, that she desires publicly to
profess the religion of the Naz——of Jesus.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy felt a twinge of an old pain, and for a
moment queried within: “Will the old struggle over
faiths again confront us?” But he dismissed it with
an unexpressed “Impossible, we’re all changed!” Then
replied he quietly with a question. “Does the dear
girl fully understand the seriousness of the act? If she
do and then acts, I’ll be glad to commit her to Christ
as her Bridegroom and King.”</p>

<p>“We cannot be with her always, and she seems determined
to go through life unwed.”</p>

<p>“A Neb-ta, an angel spinster, mothering other people’s
chicks! But what says my Rizpah of our daughter’s
purpose to profess her faith?”</p>

<p>“I? This: God being my Helper, I’ll never again
stand between Him and any soul, except it be to pray
for that soul’s health.”</p>

<p>Just then the maiden entered bearing a lamp which
suddenly lighted the room, now well nigh in darkness.
She presented a most striking and suggestive figure.
Her eyes were full of her heart’s chief question, and,
standing in the light of her own bearing, she seemed
to fitly represent the part she had borne in that household.</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy, anticipating his daughter’s question,
greeted her with promptness thus: “Sunshine, thy
purpose I know. It’s all between God and thyself.
Go gladden Father Adolphus and Cornelius with an
early profession.”</p>

<p>She was filled with surprise, and voiced its chief cause:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cornelius? He’s at Jerusalem!”</p>

<p>“Well, if so, ’tis wonderful, since I met him here
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she meditated, meanwhile speaking her
thoughts as if unconscious of those about her, “What
brought him here?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied the father, “he says ‘to see Father
Adolphus about the church of Jerusalem;’ but Father
Adolphus says ‘the young man came because he could
not help it, to see his good angel.’”</p>

<p>“‘His good angel!’ Whom?”</p>

<p>“Now, Sunrise, guess! When thou dost so, to make
short work, begin with the good angel of us all, Miriamne.”</p>

<p>Miriamne lifted her hand reprovingly, but the tell-tale
crimson hung confession on her cheeks, while her
lips, wreathed in smiles, told her pleasure.</p>

<p>“Well, now, will my father go with me to good
Adolphus about my profession?”</p>

<p>“As thou mayst like, but it will be easier to reduce
three to two than four to two!”</p>

<p>Again the uplifted, reproving hand and the blush
and Miriamne ran out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Do not reöpen that question settled once; it can
only pain us both to recur to it.”</p>

<p>“‘Reöpened!’ ‘Settled!’” exclaimed Cornelius.
“Not with me. Nothing in silence can settle it; and it
is always open to me, sleeping or waking.”</p>

<p>“The consciousness of duty done comes like the
breezes of Galilee, turning all moanings to a song within
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Miriamne, who is it decrees that we, belonging,
all, each, to the other, should be torn asunder ruthlessly?
Duty, conscience! Hard metallic words when they
describe the links of a chain! Ah, our misconceptions
often bind us to pain; this one I cannot bear!”</p>

<p>“And yet, Cornelius, you told me in that Adriatic
storm you could as easily drown a passion rising
against righteousness as you could drown the body
then, by a plunge into the billows!”</p>

<p>“You held me back when I moved forward to show
how easily I could make the plunge.”</p>

<p>“But then you had no intention of leaping to
death!”</p>

<p>“Not while held back by Miriamne!”</p>

<p>“I? Poor, weak I, hold you?”</p>

<p>“To me your touch has ever had persuasion and
might! Oh, woman, you lead me captive to your will
in chains riveted, unyielding, and yet of golden delights.”</p>

<p>“Say not so. We have each a great mission, but apart.”</p>

<p>“Apart! The decree that settles our courses that
way is monstrous. It is not of God. He ordained
that our race go in pairs. And when He set up the
new kingdom of Jesus, its heralding disciples were sent
forth two by two. As Moses needed his Hobab, Christ
his confidants, so need I a yoke-fellow. I’ve no ambition
to live, much less to work, unless I have my heart’s
idol with me.”</p>

<p>“Illusion.”</p>

<p>“Call it ‘<i>Maya</i>’ if you like; but ‘<i>Maya</i>,’ Brahm’s
wife, illusion, made the universe visible to him. So
say those ancient mythologians. I can see nothing
without my Miriamne!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, man, hold; nor pain me further! I cannot
help you. How can I, since my own chosen work
seems too great for me! I’m like a mere shell, drifting
with the tides, without sail or helm; the harbor unknown.
I only know I carry a precious pearl, truth,
and that there are those who need it. I must bear it
to them.”</p>

<p>“I’m a shell, without helm or sail, and have the same
pearl. Let me voyage with you.”</p>

<p>“And—what?”</p>

<p>“In all brevity—marry me!”</p>

<p>“That cannot be, I fear. I’d rather be the——. Can’t
I be your ideal as Mary?” She blundered amid
her efforts to express herself, and the tell-tale blush
betokened defeat.</p>

<p>“Yes; be my Mary, and let me take the place as
your Joseph. Mary was a wife and mother. The
greatest of God’s works in the old dispensation was to
translate men; in the new dispensation, seeking to surpass
the old, He presented a perfect woman, in her
highest estate, as the queen of a home!”</p>

<p>The woman was silent for time. There then seemed
to her to be two Miriamnes, and the debate was transferred
from being between the young man and herself
to these two which she seemed to be. One Miriamne
said “Yield,” one “Be firm.” One said, “He has the
better reasons,” one said “Nay;” one said, “It is pleasant
to be overcome,” the other said “<i>Maya, Maya,
Maya!</i>” Then recovering herself she exclaimed, “I
wish the priest were here; he’d guide us by the Divine
word.”</p>

<p>“I have a holy text,” and drawing a line at a venture,
the youth repeated these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘<i>God said it is not good that man should be alone!</i>’”</p>

<p>She smiled and stammered:</p>

<p>“Oh, Cornelius! I want to admire you and lean on
you as my guide, teacher, pastor; but you meet all my
approaches that way, transformed to a lover.”</p>

<p>“<i>Maya! Maya!</i> Miriamne; let the illusion work;
sleep the Leathen sleep; yield to love’s dream; then
comes the full noon to awaken to marriage joy. Thou
wilt find, not above thee but at thy side, then, the
teacher, guide; shepherd as well; but also the husband.”</p>

<p>Miriamne had reached a point of hesitancy, which is,
in all lives, just a step from surrender, and the lover,
made alert by his ardor, perceived the advantage.
Though a prey to hopes and fears, an incarnation of
paradoxes, in which bashfulness contested with audacity
for control of the will, he gathered all his powers
into a grand charge. With a tender vehemence he
stormed the citadel of the heart before him. First he
imprisoned her hand in his; he had done so before.
Now it fluttered strangely; presently it rested as a
bird; at first as if frightened, then helpless, then content.
All that followed may be easily imagined. Suffice
to say that Cornelius Woelfkin just then believed
life worth living and the universe made visible, though
not by an illusion.</p>

<p>Just as many another of Eve’s daughters placed as
she in a tempest of delights, she confessed her capitulation
by a series of retorts, which gave her relief from
tears by affording apologies for laughter.</p>

<p>“No woman ever so loved as I now? You men all
talk that way at betrothal!”</p>

<p>“‘To death!’ Miriamne, ’twill be true with me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, at betrothal and when their wives are dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
they say men are very affectionate. But, Cornelius,
remember I’ll expect sweets between times. Do not
love me to death at first, vex me to death later, then
go mad for love’s sake after I’m gone!”</p>

<p>He vowed, protested and assured; she believed him
without the shadow of a doubt. They were irrevocably
committed to each other now. There was a rush of
thoughts, plannings, questionings and hopes. Two
lives apart converging, becoming mysteriously one.
Over them arose that wondrous sun which illumines
some betrothal days. They were both very happy,
very proud, and also each to the other very beautiful.
The harmless conceits of love possessed them and they
persuaded themselves easily that they were at the center
of all things, even of the infinite love of God. The
glow of their own hearts brightened to them all things
immediately about them, and they entered that arcana
of delights where secret blessings may be experienced
but can not be depicted. They ate of that hidden
manna which is reserved alone for those who sincerely
love and are loved. No being ever loved as they, who
afterward despised or regretted the enchantment, although
it brought some pain or at the last ended in
disappointment. None ever having been for a season
in that Beulah-Land but wishes himself there again.
None who comprehends the thrillings of lover days
can fail to envy more or less, if they are loveless, those
who are in love as these twain were.</p>

<p>Much of the ridiculing of this grand passion, affected
by some, is after all the result of envy, secretly longing
for that beyond its reach. Sometimes the enraptured
themselves attempt this deriding, but theirs is an
hysterical laughter, a feeble effort to rest from the intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
of their rapture or to hide their secret from
others. The laughter of all such as the foregoing is
hollow and eventually turns the shame back upon the
ridiculers who would cover others with it; for love,
while it is an angel of sunshine, has also the power of
carrying to every heart which shamefully entreats it
remorse, humiliation and pains as numberless as
nameless.</p>

<p>Cornelius and Miriamne, the young reformers, having
embarked fully upon the full, glowing, exalting,
triumphant tide of their love were themselves reformed
and transformed. A while ago each was willing to die
for the world, now each was willing to die, if need be,
for the other and not for humanity’s sake, unless some
way the heart’s idol was to be part of the reward of
that sacrifice. This new tide carried them quickly to
that place of paradoxical oscillations, the place where
the lover is one moment utterly self-denying, the next
utterly grasping; willing to be annihilated one instant
in behalf of another, and then in an avariciousness
without a parallel on earth, the next moment willing
to annihilate the universe rather than be bereft of the
one object deemed above all others.</p>

<p>The young lovers passed through the usual, often
experienced, often depicted, old, old, ever new phases
of this relation. The fire kindled in their hearts sped
from center to center of their beings, the laughter of
secret joy quivered along every nerve of each. Each
was happier than it was possible to tell, even that other
one that awakened the joy. Their gait, their blushing
cheeks, their flashing eyes, and their words proclaimed
unmistakable the complete coronation of love. They
believed, and perhaps properly, that they were enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
the seraphic, exuberant, mellow, yet exciting delights
of an hundred ordinary lives merged into one.
Each in turn, over and over, in repetitions that tired
neither to utter nor to hear, said to the other: “I love
you.” A rain of impassioned kisses made reply. Time
was not observed; they forgot their former hurry, that
pushed them earnestly, ever toward duty, when they
were committed to being reformers. They were only
and completely lovers now, and lovers are beings whose
existence is in a heaven where there are no clocks.
The sun set over Bozrah while the twain communed,
but there was so much light in their hearts they did
not observe the lull of night around them. Existence
seemed to them a living fullness, a soaring upward without
friction or effort, and they incarnated that which
at last makes heaven, perfect desire perfectly satisfied.
They were presently recalled to the things outside of
themselves by the sound of some one approaching.</p>

<p>“It’s Father Adolphus. I know his step,” remarked
Miriamne.</p>

<p>Cornelius, remembering his recent, successful assault,
was encouraged to attempt another. His heart whispered
to him: “Why not make this matter final now?”
His heart seemed to grow pale and trembled at its own
whispering, until he himself grew pale and trembled
throughout his whole being, at the audacity of the
thought. But love’s suggestions are ever very domineering;
this one dominated the man instantly, and he
acted on it.</p>

<p>“Miriamne, why not permit Father Adolphus now
to seal our betrothal with his blessing?”</p>

<p>“He will bless us, I know,” quoth the maiden, evasively;
but she knew what her lover meant full well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Not only so, her heart, against her judgment, was
siding for the blessing.</p>

<p>The youth felt certain he had carried one line of defense,
and now went charging onward, determined to
carry all before him.</p>

<p>“Yes; he will bless us, I know, if we ask him. I’ll
ask him, and then, Miriamne, mine, I’ll call thee no
more sister, but wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are in such a hurry! This is all too sudden.
I—only wanted to be engaged—not married,
perhaps, for years. We could work for the Master—”</p>

<p>She was interrupted, as victorious lovers usually interrupt.</p>

<p>Just then the priest entered. Miriamne tried to
greet him with a smile and a sentence, but she was under
a spell. She seemed to herself to be a different
woman than she was when he last met her guide. She
spoke a few meaningless words, which were lost in the
vigorous utterance of her companion, as he explained
the betrothal and requested its ratification.</p>

<p>The aged man of God looked tenderly down on
both, and then questioned:</p>

<p>“Miriamne, I know his heart toward thee; is thine
resting on his?”</p>

<p>The maiden drooped her eye-lids, but the tell-tale
blush on her cheek gave answer.</p>

<p>“Shall I commit you to each other before God, forever!”</p>

<p>Her hand rose in an effort to restrain, but it fell back
into her lap, as if unwilling to do so.</p>

<p>“Bless us quickly, good father, I pray you,” spoke
Cornelius.</p>

<p>“Clasp four hands crossed,” said the priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden’s hands joined those of the young man,
and yet one drew back a little, as if to say, Wait.
The motion was slight; then she found voice.</p>

<p>“But, Father Adolphus, do you think God will condemn,
if we do?”</p>

<p>“God made such as ye are to love each other. What
says thy conscience? Speak frankly now, girl; thou art
with those that care for thee with an eternal regard.”</p>

<p>“My conscience does not condemn, and I commit
all I am to the guidance of you two men. I feel
quiet and safe in the committal.”</p>

<p>And the solemn sealing words were soon spoken.</p>

<p>“Shall I pronounce you husband and wife?” questioned
the priest.</p>

<p>Cornelius, like a knight in full charge desirous of
taking all before him as trophy, exclaimed quickly,
confidently: “Yes, yes, all!”</p>

<p>Then Miriamne recovered herself in the emergency,
and with maidenly dignity and tenderness, yet with
unalterable firmness, said: “Nay.”</p>

<p>“But, Miriamne—”</p>

<p>The youth could proceed no further. He was defeated
by the glance that met his, filled with pious,
kindly, yet firm dissent. She spoke then freely.</p>

<p>“Before God we are affianced; the first step, as an
Israelite, I’ve taken. We are now bound to each
other forever. I am proud to wear the yoke of betrothal.
We must wait before the final words are
spoken, until we’ve seen my parents, and until God
has given us further wisdom.”</p>

<p>She prevailed. Shortly after the foregoing, Cornelius,
taking a tender farewell, returned to his work at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Another Easter, to some the brightest yet,
smiled in Bozrah, and Miriamne was at the
Christian Chapel.</p>

<p>Father Adolphus, after serious, tender
greeting, questioned:</p>

<p>“I wonder thy father came not to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s celebrating the resurrection of love, joy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
and peace, at home. You often told me these were
the realities of Christ’s rising.”</p>

<p>“Thy joy in this must reach all fullness?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m in a strange way—very happy,
yet very restless.”</p>

<p>“I have seen souls before at their noon; hast thou
not observed how the air seems to tremble sometimes
at midday? This is not fear but fullness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my shepherd, I’m not at noon yet, only dawn.
I’ve only begun my work.”</p>

<p>“Has our missionary Cupid other couples at odds to
reunite?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; but whether God calls me to such
work or not, this much I know, He has put a burden
on me.”</p>

<p>“Will Miriamne confide it to me—or has the lover
dethroned the priest?”</p>

<p>“There now, never say that again! None on earth
can dethrone in my heart my constant friend and
guide; yea under God, my savior! Had there been
no Father Adolphus there would have been no lover;
at least no Christian Cornelius, as my heart’s lord.”</p>

<p>“I fear Miriamne in her generous desire to cheer a
tired old man flatters.”</p>

<p>“No; not flattery, but just award. As the ancient
captives on their return to their own Israel gave their
wealth to provide crowns for their priests, so do I to-day
offer the finest gold of my heart to the man who
piloted me with purity, patience, and wisdom, along
and over perilous ways, to happiness beyond all words
to express.”</p>

<p>The old missionary’s face expressed the wondrous
comfort he felt in the words of his convert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what is it that burdens thee, daughter?”</p>

<p>“I hope my pastor will not be offended, but I’m
burdened by the slow dawning of religious day. Why
does it take so long to convert the earth?”</p>

<p>“The zeal of the young convert fills thee!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but that trite answer, defense of the slow progress
of true or false creed, after all does not answer.
I feel those Easter services at times lifting me up, out
of and beyond myself, out of all thought of my own
final glory, and to anxiety for a lost Israel, a lost world!
I think, at times, I comprehend what was meant by
the descent to the grave, the captivity of death, the
triumphal ascent, and then I wonder and doubt.”</p>

<p>“Wonder and doubt?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I wonder at the grandeur of all that the
resurrection implies, and seeing it unrealized I doubt
whether my interpretation of it be the right one.
Worse than that, I’m pained by darker doubts. Forgive
me, but my poor soul sometimes questions
whether or not God has grown weary or failed to keep
His promises. Oh, these doubts pain me to my heart’s
core, but they will come! I see day by day on every
hand such widespread gloom; not only that very few
walk in the light, but how many shadows fall on those
who profess to have entered the light of the Rising?”</p>

<p>“Alas, day drags wearily!” slowly responded the
priest.</p>

<p>“Yes; the centuries since Calvary, filled with misery,
ignorance, and sin, seem to me to have rebuke in them
to all who saw, from time to time, the Gospel light, and
imperious urgency for those who see it now.”</p>

<p>“But the church is doing its best to get onward,
Miriamne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>“That I doubt, though I’d fear to be heretical.”</p>

<p>“Again, I do not comprehend thee, girl.”</p>

<p>“That’s it; I do not comprehend myself, or what it
is that I’m stirred to be or do. I think that there’s
a reason for sadness at Easter time. It is the reminder
of a great hope unfulfilled. Over twelve hundred
years have passed away since Christ arose, typical
of the rising of mankind by faith to all that was noble
and blissful, and yet we are all in the dim twilight of
the morning. Oh, my teacher, it seems to me as if a
funeral chord went weeping through every Easter
anthem.”</p>

<p>The old priest sat silently for a time, then bowed his
head and wearily sighed; “I have done my best any
way!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not think I doubt that! No, no; I’d not
hint a rebuke of my noble guide; but I can’t make
you understand me! Nobody seems to grasp my
meaning! Yet of this I’m certain, I want to do something
differing from what has been; something great,
revolutionary, for the world, for Christ.”</p>

<p>“All reforms are revolutionary; all consecration to
noble work, noble.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I express myself as vaguely as other
Christians, whose efforts are chiefly words. But why
is it that there can not be a presentment of Divine
truth in such a simple and attractive form as to make
all hearing and seeing love it? Why is it that the followers
of truth separate into armies, not only not
sympathizing with, but opposing each other? Why do
not all having a common Father and one Saviour, join
as one loving family to bear aloft the banner of the
Invincible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>“That day will come in God’s good time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, again forgive me; but that trite apology for the
delayed dawn seems to me to fling the blame on God
in order to palliate man’s indifference.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne, thou art thoughtful beyond thy years,
but what wouldst thou have?”</p>

<p>“Some one to show me how, and when, and where
to proclaim a revolution! There is need that Israel
believe; that one half the race, its women, be crowned
with its full privileges and powers; that Christian
humanity check war, banish poverty and bring in universal
justice.”</p>

<p>“Revolutionist, indeed; though a blessed one art
thou!”</p>

<p>“So I’m often told; but who will show me how to
work for such ends!”</p>

<p>“Hast thou among thy knightly companionships
heard of the Grail knights?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of them; but not a great deal. Why
ask?”</p>

<p>“Thou art like them.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know whom I’m like; tell me of them
that I may know myself.”</p>

<p>“They, as their life work, and with charming enthusiasm,
sought an object pure and noble, but which none
but they themselves could see.”</p>

<p>“Did they obtain their object and do much good?”</p>

<p>“They were a blessing to the world; but sometimes,
like others seeking lofty ends, they failed. Eternity
alone can estimate their work and worth.”</p>

<p>“Where are they now?”</p>

<p>“Their successors are like thee. That grail guild of
old is now no more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me all about them and the Grail!”</p>

<p>“Listen. Joseph of Arimathæa, he that secretly followed
the Lord in his lifetime, and openly, after he
saw the glory of His crucifixion, is said to have caught
the blood that flowed from the speared side in the paschal
vessel or cup used at the last supper. There is a
cathedral in Glastonbury, England, which once I saw,
erected on the place where Joseph builded a little
wicker oratory, when there as a missionary. At least
they say he once was there. The aged Joseph died and
the Grail or Passion cup passed into the custody of other
holy men. Finally a custodian of it sinned, and thereupon
it was caught away quickly to heaven. But there
is a legend that it is brought, from time to time, to
earth, only to be seen by those that are pure—virgin
men and women. Then out of the yearnings for the
cup’s presence (for it is said it gave unutterable joy
as well as miraculous healings to any that came nigh
to it), an order of knights sprung up, to seek it, everywhere
in earth. They were sworn not to disclose their
mission, and bound, as their only hope of success,
to keep their hearts noble and pure.”</p>

<p>“But how am I like a ‘grail knight?’”</p>

<p>“Miriamne pursues a heavenly cure for human ills, a
something she cannot see nor quite explain.”</p>

<p>“’Tis true and wonderful.”</p>

<p>“The ‘grail’ story is almost as old as man, being
shaped out of other most ancient pilgrim quests. All
noble hearts yearn for a healer and ideal.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the time has come for a woman crusade, a
new order of grail seekers?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I think as much; and Miriamne, taking
Mary as her model, may be the very one to proclaim it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>“But being a woman, and so young, I might be ridiculed
as an enthusiast, as brazen, perhaps, or worse, if
I attempted such things.”</p>

<p>“If thou didst undertake any thing truly good, thou
wouldst best know its goodness by the bitterness of its
opposing. The cross is very bright on one side, on the
other it casts shadows. Walking toward it we walk in
those chastening shadows. But when we’ve passed the
grave, which it ever guards, there is light, all light—not
before.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think I’m a very womanish woman
and not the stuff of which the heroine can be made.”</p>

<p>“To be a woman is to have within thee a wealth of
power. To be queenly is to do in queenly spirit the
work falling to thy lot. Behold the queenly women
of the patriarchs! Rebecca watered the flocks, Rachel
was a shepherdess. The daughter of Jethro, King of
Midian, also kept the flocks; and Tamar baked bread.
The Word of God records these things, methinks, to
show in what a queenly way a queenly woman may
perform a seemingly unimportant work. Doing humble
works well, they had their honor in due time.
Think of our Mary, Mother of Jesus, after her call,
serving humbly as a good housewife to a carpenter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only catch the flavor of her life more
fully!”</p>

<p>“A worthy wish! Her life was a sermon on faith.
Called of God to bring forth Immanuel, she accepted
the trust with joyful humility, leaving the miraculous
performance to the Promiser. For thirty years, from
Bethlehem’s cradle to Bethabara, where Her Son was
owned of God, she bore her pains and toils, facing persecutions,
the leers and slanderous innuendoes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
rabble, all without faltering. Only wondrous faith
kept her gentle young heart from breaking! I think
she carried the cross all along the course of Christ’s
life—until He Himself took it. She wrought out her
work as a satellite of her son, and yet as a poem most
eloquent, voicing thoughts without which some of His
wondrous, greater life would lack explanation.”</p>

<p>“I fain would be like her, but then to be so seems
beyond my capacities.”</p>

<p>“If thou canst not be a satellite of the Sun as Mary,
be a satellite of a satellite. Reflect her, and it will be
well, since she reflected Him. ’Tis a simple lesson,
but profitable; learn it; there is greatness in little
things; regarding them we may at the same time lay
hold of that that is great. I’d have all women heroines
by teaching them what heroism is.”</p>

<p>“Was Mary learned? She had to meet some grand
company?”</p>

<p>“Wise, as thou mayst be in the solid culture of
God’s word.”</p>

<p>“But I can never be a Mary,” presently the maiden
murmured.</p>

<p>“Thou canst be thyself, and what thou canst. A
seraph could be no more. God needed for his lofty
purpose but one like the Maiden of Nazareth, and for
thy comfort remember Mary could not have been the
mother of Jesus and Miriamne de Griffin of Bozrah
also. She had her mission, thou thine; it is a judgment
of God to attempt to say that each in her station
was not and is not placed in the way most excellent.”</p>

<p>Their converse ended but to be renewed. At frequent
intervals Miriamne advised with her guide
upon the subject uppermost in her mind, and more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
more became endued with the spirit of the missionary.
To all questionings within herself, as to how she might
compass her lofty and philanthropic designs, there came
but one answer, “To Jerusalem!” It seemed to her
that there, at the heart of Syrian life, she might obtain
inspiration and wisdom, as well as the widest possible
opportunity of applying these for others. To her to
believe was to act, and so she soon had completed all
her arrangements to join a band of pilgrims passing
by way of Bozrah toward the great city. The parting
was painful to mother and daughter, and unlike any
they had experienced before. The daughter felt a misgiving.
Her mother was aged. The tensions of trial
and responsibility being removed so largely from the
life of the latter by recent events, left her spiritless.
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that in the
days of excitement and conflict she exerted herself
beyond her ability; now, when the motive was gone,
nature proclaimed its premature exhaustion. Miriamne
was convinced that she would be motherless ere long,
and was haunted by misgivings as to ever again seeing
her if she left Bozrah. Rizpah herself, though she
feared that the present separation and farewell were to
be final, urged her child tenderly, earnestly, to go forward
as conscience dictated. The parting between
these two women was secret, they two being alone.
It was affectionate and most tender, and yet cheered
by the mutual hope both expressed of an eternal reunion
after death. The eventful day and the supreme
moment came to find Miriamne and her mother nerved
for the parting. That was soon over, and the maiden
moved out of the old stone home toward the white
camel already caparisoned for her use. Father Adolphus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
and Sir Charleroy awaited her by its side, having
repeated, over and over, to the maiden’s chosen attendant
a score of directions, and having in the fussiness of
nervousness again and again examined bridle and girt
and hamper. The maiden, glancing after the caravan
of pilgrims which was to be her convoy, now slowly
passing out of the city, turned toward her father to say
the last words of parting. She began: “And now,
dear father.” Her voice, tremulous to begin with,
broke down.</p>

<p>“There, Miriamne,” interrupted the knight, “wait,
we’ll accompany thee a little distance.” The three
moved out of the city together, the attendant riding
on before them. They were all too sorrowful to speak
cheerfully, so each said nothing. On the crest of a
hillock the old priest paused; simultaneously the father
and daughter did likewise. “I’m too weary to go
further,” spoke the priest. Miriamne’s eyes filled
with tears, and Sir Charleroy, drawing close to the
maiden, turned his eyes away. He stood in silence
gazing afar, but at nothing. Each at the last seemed
to dread to be the first to speak that one word so
inexpressibly sad when believed to be about to be
spoken as a last “farewell.” The silence became
oppressive, and then Father Adolphus murmured, “I
suppose we must bid thee adieu, now.” Sir Charleroy
shuddered and drew his turban down over his eyes.</p>

<p>Just then all the child and all the woman in Miriamne’s
nature was awakened. Her feelings well nigh
over-mastered her, and she exclaimed: “Oh, Bozrah,
how can I leave thee and thy dear ones!” Bozrah to
her meant home; for a moment her world seemed centred
there. The old priest, ever adroit in ministering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
comfort, sought to divert the thoughts of those about
him from needless pain, and so shading his eyes looked
steadily eastward for a few moments. Then he questioned:
“Daughter, canst thou see Salchad, at the
Crater’s Mouth. I can not see it for my sight faileth;
but I know ’tis yonder.” Miriamne followed the
direction of the priest’s pointing hand, though she
knew full well without directing, where the grim fortress
city lay. Habit had made it natural to follow the
guidance of that old, trembling hand. Some way, it
helped her; she seemed better to understand what she
already partly knew, when it directed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it. It is there; changeless and dreary as
ever. But why this question?”</p>

<p>“Dost thou observe how the prospect fades away
south of it, until it reaches the spreading desert?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I perceive!”</p>

<p>“Turn to the north, what object is most striking?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hermon! ‘The old-man mountain;’ the sun
makes its snowy-top appear to-day very like the white
on an old man’s head and chin.”</p>

<p>Sir Charleroy’s attention was recalled from his contemplation
of the pain of parting for an instant, and he
questioned:</p>

<p>“Canst thou see aught of the ruins of the ‘Temple
of the Sun,’ said to be at Hermon’s crest?”</p>

<p>But before an answer could be given to the knight’s
question, Father Adolphus exclaimed: “Daughter,
look back again to ruined Salchad! Beyond its ‘war
tower of giants,’ there lies only the desert. Now turn
thy back on it all forever, without repinings. Leave
the desert and the war tower of the giants to the wandering
Bedouin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p>“Turn thy face toward Jerusalem, thy back to the
drear desert—”</p>

<p>The maiden almost involuntarily complied, and the
priest continued:</p>

<p>“Go forward with Hermon on thy right. Remember
that the temple of the Fire Worshipers is overturned,
its altars cold; but more remember that on
Hermon humanity was transfigured in answer to
prayer.”</p>

<p>“And so my shepherd and guide would promise me
blessing and bid me God speed?” quoth the maiden.</p>

<p>“Thou read’st my heart, daughter.”</p>

<p>“The same true heart; it never gets old or weary of
cheering.”</p>

<p>“I’m made grateful and happy, daughter, by thy
words. He that saith, ‘<i>Let not your hearts be troubled!</i>’
and ‘<i>comfort ye, comfort ye my people</i>,’ is my leader.
For cheering, I was called.”</p>

<p>“How noble such a call seems to me, now.”</p>

<p>“Yea; daughter, if one can not be as the stars that
fought in their course for Sisera, he may be as a summer
evening’s breeze, in cooling pain’s fevers, and in
drying the tears from cheeks that blush through the
rains of weeping times.”</p>

<p>Gently, firmly she guided her camel from the hillock,
on which it was feeding, toward the highway, along
which the caravan was departing. “We must be going
now.”</p>

<p>At her words, Sir Charleroy and the old Sacrist each
caught one of her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, my fathers!” was her pitying but not pitiable
exclamation. Sir Charleroy, standing on the hillock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
by the camel, on which his daughter was mounted,
drew the hand he held close to his heart, then his arm
tenderly encircled its owner. The maiden’s head
rested upon the breast that had often borne her since
babyhood, her lips met in unfeigned tenderness those
of the man who not only loved her as a daughter, but
as his good angel, almost savior. It was a scene for
a painter; the past and the present, sunset and morning;
the one looking back in a confessed ineffectiveness
of a life nearly spent, in contrast with a fresh,
young, hopeful life, before which lay a world to be
conquered. Miriamne, the called leader in a new
crusade for women, for humanity, was bidding farewell
to the ruins of giant land, and to a representative of
the last of the sworded-crusaders.</p>

<p>Her staff fell on the side of the beast that bore her
and it moved away quickly after the departing troop.</p>

<p>The parting was over, and yet the two old men
silently lingered at the place of the farewell. Once or
twice the maiden looked back to them, as she was
borne forward, to wave an adieu. The lone watchers
followed her with their eyes, until her white camel appeared
but a speck moving along at the skirt of a column
of dust. The eyes of the watchers dimmed by years,
now supplemented by tears, presently could discern only
dust. She was buried from their view forever. Then
they silently returned to the city, each busy with his
own thoughts. Thereafter there was a heavy loneliness
on all hearts in that Bozrah circle. The priest moved
about his chapel, and the parents about their home as
though an angel of light had gone from their midst, or
as if the angel of death had come among them.</p>

<p>“It seems strange like,” said the Sacrist’s sister, “to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
let a girl go away to that far-off city, among strangers,
and about such meaningless purposes.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; never mind, sister, God’s lambs are
ever safe. Her mission is clear to her, at least, and
she’ll not be among strangers. The knights who secretly
abide in the city of God have a charge concerning her
in letters I’ve sent them. As well, Cornelius, her betrothed,
is there. Pure love will be her wall of fire.”
Thus ended all arguments and misgivings.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HOSPITALER’S ORATION.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not say that a social cyclone is impending; but the signs
of the times certainly admonish us that if Christianity is to avert a
revolution of the most gigantic proportions, and the most ruinous
results, we have not an hour to lose in assuring the restless masses
that they have no better friends than are the professed disciples
of Him whose glory it was to preach the gospel to the poor, and to
lift up their crushing burdens.”—<span class="smcap">Rev. Dr. A. J. F. Behrend’s</span>

princes from their thrones, and exalted them of low degree.”—<span class="smcap">Mary.</span></p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The daughter of Sir Charleroy found a home
and a mother with Dorothea Woelfkin, the
widowed parent of her affianced. What
manner of woman the latter was may be
readily inferred from the character of her beloved and
only son, Cornelius. It sufficeth to say, mother and
son were in all things wonderfully alike.</p>

<p>“Miriamne, I’ve called to ask, if we get the consent
of my mother, that you attend a conclave of knights, to
be secretly held, after Moslem prayers this evening.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At the house of the Christian sister, aged Phebe;
just by the second wall of the city.”</p>

<p>“And why do they meet?”</p>

<p>“An eloquent Hospitaler, lately returned from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
long mission, is to address the companions and their
friends.”</p>

<p>“A Hospitaler; what’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Ah, there it is; the question all ask, and none can
answer! He has given full tokens of his right to confidence,
but declines, for reasons which he says are most
pious, to reveal himself further than that he is a Knight
Hospitaler of Rhodes.”</p>

<p>“Rhodes? Is he very tall, of piercing eyes, his hair
long and jet, with streaks of gray?”</p>

<p>“Even so.”</p>

<p>“My father knew such a man, whom he called ‘silver-tongued.’”</p>

<p>“This man is as eloquent as Apollos.”</p>

<p>“We met such an one, and were with him for a time.
We left him here, on our journey from Acre to
Bozrah.”</p>

<p>“Did you penetrate his secret?”</p>

<p>“I did not, though my father once said to him
‘Grail.’ After that he kept aloof from us.”</p>

<p>“A proof it must be as I’ve suspected; the Hospitaler
is one of the new Grail-Knights!” exclaimed Cornelius.</p>

<p>“And he is here? I must hear him again. The
words he spoke to me in Gethsemane have followed
me night and day since. He made the journey of Mary
and Christ, by way of Kedron, to the cross, seem like a
present reality; a path typical of the one before
every child of God. I saw it all then, but have been
unable since to find it. Oh, I burn with desire to have
the ‘silver-tongued’ guide me to that pathway again.”</p>

<p>At the appointed time the twain sought the house
of Christian Phebe, and found it wrapped in gloom; the
only sign of life without being a man garbed as a camel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
driver, standing guard at the door. Cornelius whispered
to Miriamne, “He’s a knight—the warden.” The young
man gave the watchman a secret signal; the latter communicated
through a little gated window, with those
within, and quickly the door swung open, admitting
Woelfkin and his companion. Within were light and
cheerfulness contrasting with the gloom without. A
goodly company was already assembled, chiefly made
up of Crusaders, but now unharnessed. The faces of
the pilgrim soldiers betokened a change within. They
betokened spirits subdued, but not crushed; hearts having
surrendered ambition for devastating conquest, to
welcome a finer hope. There were few things about
the place suggestive of war, and many suggestive of
peace. At one end of the room stood a desk, in shape
much like an altar. It was draped with a Templar
banner, and to its side were fastened a sword, bent in
the shape of a sickle, and two spears forming a cross,
supporting a cup; the latter was in form the same as
the cup of the Passion.</p>

<p>“There is something about this place that recalls the
chapel of the Palestineans, in London, Cornelius.”</p>

<p>“Well, you and I were there; now we are here. In
that the two places have likeness,” pleasantly responded
the maiden’s escort.</p>

<p>Miriamne’s eyes wandered from object to object, as
if seeking proof of, her assertion, and her companion
followed her gaze with a glance about the place, which
finally rested, as his glances were wont, on the eyes of
Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Oh, the devoutness, the peace, the fellowship!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Just then there was a movement: a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
men present arose; a hailing sign, significant to the
initiated, was given by some, while simultaneously a
slight applause passed around the room:</p>

<p>“’Tis he,” whispered Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Your Hospitaler?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The knights all stood and sang in subdued voices, a
psalm of hope. “The movement of the melody suggests
pilgrims climbing a hill.” At least, so the maiden said
its movement seemed to her.</p>

<p>When the psalm was finished, the knights resumed
their seats and the Hospitaler, without preliminary,
at once addressed them:</p>

<p>“Knights of Christ, few and often in hiding, I would
remind ye that no plan of God is futile, and that His
cause has no backward movement.</p>

<p>“A dream of conquest, restoration and glory came
over all followers of the cross. The dream had
within it a hope of a holy land in Christian possession,
and all the children of earth getting from it the story
of the true faith. Then there was to come, we believed,
the golden age, in which all mankind in sweet
charity’s glorious fellowship should go forward.</p>

<p>“Nature, man’s mother, prays in a million mournful
voices for that golden day; and God, man’s eternal and
loving Father, works by countless invincible agencies to
cause its full dawning. We Crusaders gave our lives
by thousands for our faith, but we seemed to have done
little beside change the name of this land from Philistine
to Palestine. One, to be sure, is softer to the ear
than the other, but to the heart both names bring the
same miserable thoughts. Yet there was more than
this attained. Ye remember how our cavalier soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
expressed their chivalric impulses in honoring that
queen of women, Our Lady? Like the rising of sun at
midnight, came the conviction to Christian Europe
when at its worst, socially, that reform must begin by
purifying the homes of the people, by exalting all home
life. To do this, the mothers who bare and nurture
the fruits of the home, as well as making them for weal
or for woe what they are, must needs be exalted by
right as well as by fitness to their queenship. Every
knight’s praise of Mary was an avowal of faith; his
faith that woman could be, should be, what his imagination
pictured Mary to have been.</p>

<p>“The knightly Christians were among the first to be
moved by the belief that that was a monstrous blight,
a heresy toward God and nature which regarded the
finer sex as necessities or luxuries. Impressed by reverence
for Mary, the banded soldiers of the cross began
to feel their mission to be not only the recovery of
the dead, but also of the living from infidel dominion;
hence, each Crusade banner came as a sunburst to
those, who, under the spell of gross passion, were enslaving
their natural co-partners.</p>

<p>“Men, while the harem ideal stands, while woman is
impotent because uncrowned, our lofty hopes can not
bear fruit nor will our labors be ended!”</p>

<p>The speaker was interrupted by a murmur of applause
that ran around the circle of auditors.</p>

<p>Miriamne glowed with delight, and raised her hand
impressively and nodded toward Cornelius. He only
saw the motion and easily interpreted it as meaning,
“There, that’s what I felt, but could not express.”</p>

<p>The speaker continued: “God said it is not good
that the man should be alone; time that resolves all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
mysteries, and experience which transmutes to gold all
the rubbish of guess and experiment, has irrevocably
declared that man cannot be to his fullness, in a state
of solitary grandeur. He and the woman go up or
down together; and, whether a seraph or a serpent
leads her, the man by inclination or by force is sure to
follow her footsteps.</p>

<p>“We Crusaders had a glimpse of the truth, but lost it
to follow an <i>ignis fatuus</i>. Yet, in this land, we confronted
the harem with the home ruled by one queenly
wife and mother. The world, beholding the contrast
begins to believe, as never before, in the supremacy,
over all institutions, of that one where, under Eden’s
covenant charters, purity and mother-love mold the
race in the name of sole and patient love. The Saracens
paraded their houris, their concubines, and their slaves
as the proofs of their prowess; but the Christians
challenged the array by the quality of their possessions,
commencing with their women of God’s blood royal,
and ascending to each revered personage, from love’s
companions, to Mary, to Jesus. He that nobly deals
with the one by his side will find her putting on a
glory that will brighten the luster of his kingliness,
and bringing forth to him those having the power to
grasp and mold the destinies of coming years. Listeners,
mark me; there is a lesson profound in the
record of the strugglings with each other of Rebecca’s
twins before their birth. Indeed, each being begins
his career within the life that gives him life.</p>

<p>“Who will say, with assurance, that all of life lies
within the reach of any man of himself? Nay, be it
said, rather, that she who first carries, then leads, then
inspires, as she only can, her sons and daughters, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
one who lays her gentle hands, with resistless power,
upon the keys of all futures. It is the mother who
impresses the prophecy of what is to be on the heart
of the infant, before the event finds place upon the
deathless page which records deeds done.”</p>

<p>Again applause interrupted.</p>

<p>The Hospitaler continued, as attention was given
anew:</p>

<p>“That profoundest of ancient teachers, Plato, enunciated
at least a half-truth or truth’s shadow, in his doctrine
of the preëxistence of souls, though, as our church
understands it, it pronounces the teaching heretical.
Be that as it may, this much assuredly is true: if each
man has not been on earth before, his present existence
being the repetition of a prior one, his intuitions, vague
recollections out of a past forgotten in a former death,
surely there is none who is not the fruit of his parents.
He is largely what they made him, and of the twain
that beget, I affirm that the mother wields the ruling
influence in the life and character of the begotten. I
believe men perpetuate their worst traits through their
posterity, easily and more persistently than do women
theirs. In the giant of the human pair brawn and muscle
predominate, and these, if depraved, feed every evil
passion, giving each power to run with virulence from
sire to son. The woman, formed by finer conceptions
to be an angel, may fall to sinning and let weakness
take the place of gentleness. So be it; yet even then
her weaknesses and her sinnings, constantly repugnant
to her nature as God framed it, antagonistic to the refinement
that is native, ebb and die along the shores of
her being’s course. She more naturally and more
forcefully transmits her good than she does her evil, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
a general rule. They have in fable-lore a tradition that
the mythical goddess of love, Venus, wore a resplendent
girdle, the sight of which made every beholder
love the wearer. Let me give present force to the
legend by affirming that every true woman, girded
with the virtues that it is her duty and her privilege to
wear, is an object, among all earthly beings, superlatively,
entrancingly beautiful—next after Christ, God’s
best gift to man.”</p>

<p>Cornelius now plucked the corner of Miriamne’s
<i>pepulum</i>. It was a lover’s restless, questioning act.
Being a man, trained as men, he was naturally inclined
to doubt the speaker and to join in secret ridicule, that
substitute for gainsaying when arguments are utterly
lacking; but being a lover, he was so far doubtful as to
his old creeds concerning women, as to be ready to be
led. Miriamne turned toward her lover with a smile
lightened by eyes which glowed. Hers was not the
smile of a girl flatly complacent in an effort to be very
agreeable. She believed; the love she had for the man
at her side was consecrated first to truth. Her will
was that of a blade of steel—yielding, serviceable; but
still elastic or firm, as need be and as its highest purposes
required. She smiled, but the smile mounting
to her brightening eyes, left her fine forehead, a very
temple of thought, all placid. The smile and the
glance routed all doubts from the young man’s mind.
She to him was a Venus, and more, a saint. She wore
the invisible girdle of which the knight had spoken,
and the youth felt its winning power. Another proof
that the best advocate of a woman is a woman; and of
her worth, the best argument an example.</p>

<p>The orator knight proceeded without pause:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know full well that some sneer and carp on woman’s
weakness, having recourse to Eden for argument.
To these I reply: The enemy assailed not the weaker,
but the stronger first, and exhibited masterly generalship
in seeking to overcome the citadel that would insure
the greatest loss, the most complete victory. And
note how long and arduous his siege of Eve; then remember
how quickly Adam fell. Crush the woman’s
heart, ruin her faith, degrade her body, and then, with
this work completed, we are ready to ring down the
curtain over the end of the tragedy of a wrecked world.
When men hold women to their hearts, their manhood
is enlarged and their queens become their angels, bearing
a ‘grail’ that catches for both the choice things of
heaven. But when a man turns his strength against a
woman, she ceases to be his charming, alluring helpmate.
He has brawn, and she, not having that, puts
on that cunning which is the natural arm of the weaker.
When the honey-suckle turns to poison-ivy, or the dove
to a fox, then weep; but when woman lays aside the
entrancings of her moral beauty to enter a desperate
strife with armed cunning, let men go mad over their
queens become witches. I tell you, hearers, when men
become demons women will give themselves to sorcery.
I speak not of spiritual possession, but of human deflowering.
Shall our queens be uncrowned, disrobed,
degraded? No, no, Satan alone could say ‘yea.’”</p>

<p>When the burst of applause that had interrupted
him subsided, the Hospitaler continued:</p>

<p>“We knights revere the sign of the cross because the
world’s Savior died thereon; it will be well for us to
revere womankind because it was given to woman, not
to man, to coöperate with God in bringing that Savior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
to the world. A woman bore him with crucial pains,
as each of us was borne, before He bore the cross.
And reverently I say it, companions, woman’s cross is
ever set, and all the earth is her Calvary. I can not
but see, as must you who think, that all this pain to her
has in God’s great plan some vicarious element, some
blessing for mankind. We Christians pray for the
second coming of Jesus, the Jews wait and weep for
the dawn of a day of salvation, the Mohammedans,
like hosts of the Pagans, in every clime, are longing
for some golden day; better than the present. This
universal longing is a prophecy of good to come. I
can not believe that the All-Father would suffer this
universal and intuitive longing to end in disappointment
and mockery. He is too good for that. By this
longing I see standing out, less dimly, and yet dimly
enough to be by many unseen, some sublime, prophetic
hints. Read sacred Writ. Wherever therein you discern
a prophetic character, emblem of Christ, forerunner
of the golden age, you will find not far from
him, as his partner and help, fittingly a woman!</p>

<p>“From the first it was so. Adam the first appeared,
and a woman was his partner, helpmate and more.
He fell. A way of recovery was provided for him, but
it was the woman who was given to bring forth the
One whose heel was to crush the head of the author
of humanity’s great catastrophe. Then came the
second Adam—Immanuel. At his advent the chief
figure, next after God the chief instrument in His
bringing in, by His side along the years in all helpful
ministries, a woman, Mary, the beautiful, the perfect,
the ideal of women.</p>

<p>“Again and again we have puzzled over the records,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
wondering why Matthew traced the genealogy of Jesus
along the male line only, through David and Jacob
to Abraham the father of the faithful, and that Luke
traced that genealogy through Mary and her father,
Heli. But there’s method most wise in the records.
Matthew wrote for the Jews, Luke for the Gentiles.
The hint is herein given that when the Gentiles are
fully gathered in, woman will be recognized in the ultimate
religion, that knows neither race nor sex. As
in the royal line which gave man a Savior, as in a
queenly line having for man, society and home—the
emblem of heaven expressed on earth—blessing and
saving powers.”</p>

<p>The knight closed with an appeal for the continuance
of the revival of the chivalrous spirit toward
woman, saying:</p>

<p>“It matters little what becomes of the dust of the
pious dead; the past is secure, and Deity guards till
the resurrection all tombs in His own unfrustrated
way, but it matters much how we treat the living!
That is a puerile piety which is ready to die to defend
from foes that can not harm inanimate ashes that
appeal for no favor, while suffering, willingly, living
bodies encompassing bleeding hearts, to continue amid
untold agonies, their whole existence one long appeal
for succor! Christian knights, on with your new crusade,
and may the golden age come grandly in, its fruits—love,
joy, and peace in every clime, to every race, to
every man, woman, and child!”</p>

<p>The speaker sat down; there was a moment of deep
silence, followed by an outburst of approving acclamations.</p>

<p>Then ensued a hum of voices, the assembly breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
up into little groups, one and another attempting each
to prove his loyalty, his piety or his good sense to the
man next to him, by certifying his belief in the knight’s
words.</p>

<p>Miriamne, half unconscious of her surroundings, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, will not some one tell me how to begin?”</p>

<p>“Can I aid my Miriamne?” asked her lover.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; perhaps. But that Grail Knight
with the silver tongue sees, in his soul, what I would
reach. When he speaks my feet take wings. I can
not tell you what or how it all is. He speaks and I
see, as Moses in the mount, the outline of the tabernacle
of God that is to be with men.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">An uneventful year passed over the missioners,
but it was followed quickly by eventful
times.</p>

<p>Two messages came, one after the other,
and not far apart, to Jerusalem, which moved all the
Christian colony at the latter place, but especially Cornelius
and his consort. The first was from Father
Adolphus and as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your parents, Sir Charleroy and Rizpah, have departed
Bozrah. They went out together, and their end was peace.
They compensated themselves for the needless miseries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
they had wrought in their younger days by keeping out of
all shadows during their journey after their reconciliation
by the tomb of their children, even until sunset. I could
not summon you, for they passed away quickly, only a few
days coming between their goings.”</p>

</div>

<p>Shortly after the foregoing, came the other message,
and that accidentally, for the link between Jerusalem
and Bozrah being broken by death, there was none
left in the Giant City to send after or for comforting to
the missioners. “Father Adolphus is dead.” That
was the report brought by chance to the Christians at
Zion. Hundreds in Jerusalem had heard of him, and
hearing of his death sighed mildly. The missioners
were his mourners—really, solely.</p>

<p>Ere long Dorothea left Jerusalem of Syria for the
New Jerusalem, and this event not only brought sorrow
but also perplexity. Miriamne realized that she could
not now continue in the house of her betrothed, simply
as his betrothed, even if it were possible for the household
to continue, the head being absent. Whither
should she go, orphan and kinless as she was? Love
protested mightily against any thought of going far
from her affianced, and then she felt profound pity for
the man who mourned and felt a mother’s loss deeply,
as did Cornelius. He entreated for a speedy wedding,
and she, seeing then no alternative, consented thereto;
but as she assumed love’s yoke, she believed that the
ambition of her life was frustrated. She was not disconsolate,
neither was she tearless. She thought she
discerned the leadings of God and submitted promptly,
making it thenceforth her duty cheerfully to engage in
the, to her, seemingly commonplace works of a missionary
pastor’s wife. Her husband was a “man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
the people,” and found acceptance with the lowly. He
was wont to call himself “a priest forever after the
order of Melchisedec.” Said he anon to his flock: “Like
that mysterious man who flits across your sacred histories
am I! You of the Jews, self-elect, as God’s elect,
though disgrafted, would put me, intending to do so or
not, by the unknown and unheralded Melchisedec.
You think me, without father, without mother, beginning
of days, or end of life, because you do not find
my name in the chronologies of your high families nor
myself in the covenants of the Hebrews. You Christians
doubt my authority because no ghostly ordaining
hands have been laid upon my head. But I’m the
child of a King, and a towel, such as my Master wore as
He ministered, is robing enough for me!” Old people,
women and children, gave the young man unquestioning
love, and thus was well indorsed the choiceness of
his ministerings. Miriamne beheld these manifestations
with secret joy, for she knew that through the
one she loved she was, in part, expressing her own
thoughts and sympathies. Once wed, she was too
honest, too tender-hearted, too noble to be less than all
that wifehood implied, and yet she felt at times as if
the ambitions and hopes of her life, nursed through
many years, had not been compassed. She tried to
settle down and humbly do the work of a missionary’s
helpmate, and to overcome, through Divine grace, the
ambition to do seemingly grander things than she was
doing. Sometimes, smiling through tears, she would
say to her husband as he sought to satisfy her heart’s
yearnings with mention of the good work they were
doing:</p>

<p>“Well, a man has come between me and the ‘grail.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
I’m following him, may he follow it, and God guide
both.”</p>

<p>After a time Cornelius and Miriamne made a pilgrimage
to Bozrah, drawn thither by a desire common
to both to honor their loved ones departed. They
found the Giant City all pervaded by the spirit of the
moribund past. Even the Christian church, once a
light, a joy and a promise of a better day, had fallen
into decline at Bozrah. The edifice had become dilapidated,
the congregation was depleted.</p>

<p>In name, Father Adolphus had a successor, younger,
more learned, more eloquent in his way, than the
saintly man now sleeping. But the infidels, the very
ones who were wont to confess that they could not, if
they would, make headway against the old priest’s godly
life, now laughed to scorn the stately and scholarly
arguments of the new leader. The converts under the
new regime were few, the common people did not from
him hear the word gladly; and the regular congregation
was rent by schisms.</p>

<p>One chapel service sufficed both Miriamne and Cornelius.
They found in it nothing but cold formality
and the memory of what had been, but was now no
more.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cornelius,” Miriamne cried, “reverently I say
it, but is it not strange that our faith edges its way
over the world so slowly, with such heralds?”</p>

<p>“Leastwise, you may say, you do not see your
‘Grail’ here, Miriamne?”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, I realize the worth of Von Gombard as I
never did before.”</p>

<p>“Are you not sorrowed at his absence, Miriamne?”</p>

<p>“Sorrowed! Truly not; but unspeakably glad that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
he walks with the sons of God; a very king, I know,
amid the greatest. Oh, how sad I’d be to see the poor,
dear, tired old man with his overfull heart and trembling
limbs now going about in painful ministries here!
God was twice good; in leaving him so long, then in
taking him. Ah, if there were more like that old saint,
those that there are would not need to tarry till their
twilight.”</p>

<p>“Shall we prolong our stay?”</p>

<p>“No! I’ve listened long enough to the lull of eternity
here. Bozrah’s past has taught me its all. I’m
ready to go home.”</p>

<p>“Home! When, to-morrow?” ardently questioned
Cornelius, anxious himself to depart the Giant City.</p>

<p>“After to-morrow; the coming day, at my instance,
the memorial of my parents is to be set up.”</p>

<p>The following morning, just before sunrise, the husband
and wife repaired to the tomb of their loved
ones, to witness, by pre-arrangement, the unveiling of
a memorial. It consisted of two figures carved from
whitest marble; a woman’s form with a face expressive
of tenderness and beauty, marked with deepest grief,
but not with hopelessness. Across her lap there lay
the form of a young man, the rigors of death plainly
marked on his face and limbs. There was no mistaking
the representation, and Cornelius quickly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I know the one that sits thus holding that crucified
body! ’Tis real! Impressive! Awful!”</p>

<p>“It is fitting, think you?”</p>

<p>“I’m too much moved to judge, perhaps; though I
do wonder that you have not had carved upon the pedestal
the names of your dead, or some explanation.”</p>

<p>“Names? What matter, to the stranger passing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
who lie beneath the stone? As for the meaning, let
those who come and go question till it appear.”</p>

<p>“I’m the first questioner, Miriamne. The application?”</p>

<p>“Remember that my mother, in her almost solitary
grief, held her dead children for a time against her broken
heart, but it was a heart filled with a mother-love
which never faltered. There is nothing in love surpassing
such on earth. Then at last, when her life
work was done, her cup full, my mother, as her final
consolation, held to her heart the Son whose death
gives life, as yon Madonna holds the Christ.”</p>

<p>“I bow to Miriamne’s judgment; the creation is
appropriate; Glorious Madonna!”</p>

<p>“I have a hope that it may stand here in the Hauran
an enduring sermon to the varied races who pass.
They who come and go here, reminded that the
Nephalim with all their arrogant might left little but
their crumbling tombs; that Astarte, once the potent,
dangerous goddess of the groves, here faded from the
love of her fevered hosts, who themselves in turn faded
from the face of the earth, may pause to question what
the meaning and power of this last, new, fresh presentment!
Perhaps they will hear from those made wise,
and in time learn to tell one another, that these two
figures speak of the Deathless Kingdom, its white loves,
its wondrous rewards and its Spirit of might expressed
by all who are in it through the power of an endless
life, and through the agency of immortal influence.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne, I see thee a palpitating angel in the
flesh! I can say no more!”</p>

<p>As the young missioner thus spoke he stretched out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
his arms toward the woman he loved as if he would
restrain her. The motion came from his heart, which
was anxiously saying within: “She is growing upward
and away from her consort.” But he had neither courage
nor words to voice the vague thought which
brought admiration mixed with fears.</p>

<p>They turned toward their temporary home in the
Giant City. As they went, the rising sun flooded the
marble forms by the graves with a golden light, and
the twain, beholding the glory of that morning benediction,
felt an illumining in their hearts that some
way made heaven seem very near.</p>

<p>“And now, darling, we’ll return to Jerusalem, and
quietly pursue our work until we join those loved ones
gone on before,” spoke the husband the day after the
monument’s unveiling.</p>

<p>“I trust we shall work in future with better plans
and grander results than we have had before.”</p>

<p>“Are you discontented with what we accomplish?”</p>

<p>“No, and yes,” was her measured reply.</p>

<p>Cornelius turned his eyes full upon her, lifting
inquiringly his eyebrows.</p>

<p>She continued: “I’m satisfied, if God so will, to
blend my work into my husband’s; I know this is my
duty as a wife, but I long to echo nobler music. Can
you make it?”</p>

<p>“Annata, the Assyrian goddess, was content to be
the echo of her spouse, the mighty Ammon. I’d be
an Ammon if I could to be worthy being echoed by
Miriamne. But, little wife, your words sound almost
Delphic; and yet you are no such ambiguous oracle.
Is there any wish unmet?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a misgiving.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, wife of mine, see how strong you’ve been,
each year adding health! See the shadows over our
people. We are sent to chase these away with Gospel
truth. We’ve hitherto only learned how to work
efficiently, and in the future will do braver, greater
things than ever. We’ll tarry, as Adolphus, ay, and by
grace renew strength, turning back the dial pointer, as
with prayer, did Hezekiah of old.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not go, I know, until my work is done. None
go before such time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we must go together everywhere, even to
death.”</p>

<p>“Ah, beloved, I know your meaning. It’s the lover,
not the consecrated missionary, who speaks now.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it! I’ll be useless without you. I’m
useless now, except as you sustain me; as Abishag,
the Shunnamite, the fairest young maiden of all Israel,
brought heart to the bosom of David, old and shaken
by years, so you put into me all the ambition I have.
To my trembling heart you are what Deborah was to
Barak’s.”</p>

<p>“God help you, Cornelius; I believe you, because I
know your trusting nature and have joyed in the fullness
of your lavish love, but let us bravely face this
matter as it comes. For God, I know, I must quickly
do my work and be gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say not so, if I’m to be left alone! That must
not be! By your love for me I entreat you to stay; a
thousand ties bind my life to thine; it will kill me by
inches to have them severed!——</p>

<p>“Miriamne, my own, nearer to God by far than am I;
plead with Him to spare us this agony!”</p>

<p>“In spirit, my loyal spouse, we shall ever be near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
each other, but I feel that in the body we shall not be
together long. I shall finish my course and then——”</p>

<p>“No, not that,” vehemently exclaimed the husband.
“Say not that! I’ll work for you, with you, for God.
Help me to the end and let me so help you, beloved!”</p>

<p>“You may help me while I tarry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll joy to realize the prophet’s vision, who saw the
hands of a man under the wings of an angel. Here
are the hands and Miriamne is the angel.”</p>

<p>“But your imagination glows, kindled by the torch
of a human heart almost idolatrous.”</p>

<p>“Nay, not idolatrous; for the fire rises to things
holy. I only plead that God let me walk with Miriamne;
I know she will walk nigh Him. Go where
you will my feet will bear me thither, undertake
what you may, my heart and hand will help; point out
any goal of darling desire and thither I’ll carry you,
if need be. For you I’ll gladly die, if, at the dying, I
have the comforting assurance that soon my other self
will join me in the overshadowed land of life.”</p>

<p>“How it would brighten the world, if all who take
the holy vows of marriage on their souls were as truly
wed in heart as we.” As the twain stood by the white
marble figures at sunrise the next morning, equipped
for departure, they made a striking picture. The living
and the dead; the exemplars of the purest, deepest
wedded love committed to serving their fellow man;
they rose grandly above the ruins of the place builded
by those mighty self-seeking devotees of Astarte.</p>

<p>Bozrah sat in desolation, knowing no hope and having
a bitter past only and forever to contemplate; the
youthful gospel heralds had all life, rising to new life—hope
beyond hope, joy beyond joy, and then life, hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
and joy in endless unfoldments, stretching way through
measureless eternities, all before them. Miriamne was
pensive; Cornelius was chastened by the remembrance
of the words she had spoken the day before, and both
subdued by the presence of the majestic monument before
them.</p>

<p class="dropcap">After Jesus had been driven from His native
Nazareth, He found a home in the house
of Lazarus, Martha and Mary, in the village
of Bethany, on the eastern slope of Olivet.
That was sweet, memorable Bethany of the Gospels;
“the perfection of repose,” amid the palm and oak-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
slopes of Olivet; hidden by its quiet life, as
well as its sequestering mountain, from Jerusalem,
that great, throbbing heart of Palestine.</p>

<p>Thither, down the east steps of the Temple, through
the “Golden Gate,” along camel paths that wound past
Gethsemane and across fitful Kedron, the Son of Man
often went when worn out by His love ministries,
or harassed by the gainsayings of the great city. So,
preaching His new kingdom, He exalted its cornerstone,
the godly home, by electing one such, that of
Lazarus and his sisters, as a rest and a refuge for Himself.
Beyond this He proved His own humanity by
seeking earthly friendships, at the same time exhibiting
Himself, though the favored of heaven, the object
of constant angelic regard, as needing, because He was
human, that which humanity ever needs—congenial
human fellowships.</p>

<p>The history of that ancient Bethany family, gathered
from various sources, but chiefly from the simple and
touching narrative of the Evangelist John, is full of
interest. The mother of that home, to us nameless,
was dead. Yet she was not fameless; that circle of
children in their several relationships witnessed full well
of a finest mother-culture, that had been theirs. The
father of that family was worse than dead; he was a
leper, buried alive in the Lazar keeps of the plague-stricken,
and the husband of Martha, the elder sister,
early had left his bride widowed.</p>

<p>That was a circle cut through its center; but affliction
had knit together in deepened affection the few
left. The fatherly brother, Lazarus, well fulfilled his
double obligation, and wins admiration, as do ever
those sons and brothers who faithfully take the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
of dead fathers. That he was such a brother, the grief
of his sisters when he died fully proclaimed.</p>

<p>With a few fine sentences John depicts those sisters.
Martha, widowed in life’s morning, but surmounting all
morbidness by giving herself to motherly ministries in
her home; and then was Mary, a clinging, trusting, pious
maiden; a poem of faith, a tear-bedewed rose-wreath.
When Christ joined that circle there was presented the
finest conceivable ideal of a home. They served and
He blessed, and though their bereavements could never
be forgotten, while His banner of love was over them,
they were able to alleviate the poignancy of their
griefs through the hope of a blessed resurrection and a
final, eternal reunion.</p>

<p>The sacred associations gathering about the village
of Olivet made it a place peculiarly attractive to Cornelius
and Miriamne; for they, too, were bereaved;
neither in all the world having a single living kinsman
of whom they knew.</p>

<p>They determined, shortly after their final farewell to
Bozrah, to take up their abode at the “House of Dates,”
and were unmeasurably delighted in being able to secure
for themselves a house reputed to have been the
identical one occupied by Christ and His choice friends.
If it were not the same, there seemed good reason to
believe it was at least on the site of that ancient sacred
domicile.</p>

<p>One day they conversed of their work, their hopes,
and the needs of their field of labor.</p>

<p>“I’m led to think that we should establish a refuge
for Magdalenes, Miriamne.”</p>

<p>“If we did attempt the founding of an asylum for
outcasts we would not belie the memory of a noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
woman, who was never a harlot, by applying to it her
name. But my ‘grail’ does not lead me that way.
I’d go mad working for the utterly lost only! No; no,
our work must be more radical, by beginning back of
the falling so as to prevent it.”</p>

<p>“Something must be done to educate the women of
this country to better living and higher conceptions of
womanhood. We need a school of some kind.”</p>

<p>“A school? Good, if it be of the right kind; but
there have been schools and schools for men, such as
they were, and they have effectually proven that education
alone is not a savior. Learning does not transform
the soul, else God would have given Moses the
pattern of a college instead of that of a tabernacle.
My mother used often to tell me that the devil is
superbly educated. The more he knows the prouder
and more dangerous he becomes. I do not despise
learning, but since it is impotent to transform men,
why try it as the savior of woman? She who takes
counsel less of the intellect than of the conscience and
affections! We must seek for those we aim to help
something surpassing in direct efficacy any thing yet
attempted;” so saying, Miriamne paused.</p>

<p>“Shall we organize a church, ‘fair as the moon, clear
as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?’”</p>

<p>“There have been churches and churches. It would
be vain for me to attempt to prove to you, a theologian
and a churchman, that this you call the ‘Bride of
Christ’ is imperfect or lacking in any energy of reform;
but, though I heartily confess ’tis the choicest institution
this side of the stars, yet I see it professing to
have heavenly charity, abounding light, and measureless
joys, leaving the needy without hospitals, the heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
in ignorance, and most of the world, including many
churchmen, famishing for happiness. The trouble is,
it infolds too many wolves and repels too many lambs.
Your flocks are too much given to atoning for lean living
by fat believing; memorizing huge creeds instead of
incarnating them; putting their faith-confessions into
themselves rather than themselves into their faith professions.
You churchmen shut your ears to friendly
criticism, sneer at those that censure, and in branding
such heretics proclaim yourselves infallible. I’d not
be a vaporing railler, but I hear within your ecclesiastical
bodies of warring factions, of ambitious and multitudinous
leaders, a proof that they are of the church
militant; though theirs is an internecine militating.
I doubt if there has existed Christ’s ideal of a church
since Pentecost. He gave a glimpse of its true outlines
there, and it will yet come in its power and splendor;
then, for the pæans!”</p>

<p>“You’d organize, perhaps, a <i>Vestal Band</i>?”</p>

<p>“Vestals?”</p>

<p>“Yes; an union of women of pure hearts, committed
solely to such works as those performed in part by the
holy sisters of our church fraternities.”</p>

<p>“I revere such as are thus engaged with all my heart;
but, churchman, you are narrow in your plan; even
Pagan Rome, which honored Vesta, the fire goddess,
by having an altar to her in every community, held
that the State was a great family, and placed Vesta,
the goddess of virginal purity, near the Penates, or
gods of the household and family.”</p>

<p>“I see nothing now in this juxtaposition.”</p>

<p>“They saw that there was ruin to all society if their
girls were impure; hence buried alive a Vestal, if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
fell from her vow of chastity. You have heard, Cornelius,
how good Romans were wont to invoke, often,
as their family guardians, the manes of their departed
kin; and this very naturally; they held to the belief
that the family tie, the finest, strongest known among
men, outlived, by virtue of its heavenliness, the
shock of death. Imperial Rome trusted much its
all-conquering swords, for this life, but for the life
to come it appealed to Jupiter omnipotent or Minerva,
the all-wise. No, no, a ‘Vestal Society,’ such
as you imply, would not suffice. I’ve a broader clientage
and vaster scheme in mind, good churchman husband—”</p>

<p>“Shall I venture another guess?”</p>

<p>“It would be needless. Let me explain myself
fully. Good Father Adolphus, founder of Bozrah’s
‘<i>Balsam Band</i>,’ which he sometimes called ‘nursing
preachers,’ told me that in olden times there was in this
country a fraternity of women, banded together to
perform works of charity. They were remembered
chiefly for their helpfulness to those that were in direst
need and utterly friendless. They befriended criminals
and social outcasts. He said that the women of Jerusalem
who followed Christ weeping, were, probably,
of that fraternity, since it was the custom of that pious
company to offer their tears for those on the way to
execution. More, these women were wont to furnish
the pain-dulling herbs to victims dying condemned.
You remember the Christ was offered such herbs?
When I remember the spirit that actuated Martha and
Mary, I readily believe they were members of that
pious fraternity. More, when I remember how, for
His own dear sake, they ministered to His human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
wants, there comes to my mind the possibility of a perpetual
organization, for God’s sake, ministering to
human want, taking the home as its palace, and to be
known to the world by the expressive, winning title,
‘<i>Sisters of Bethany</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Miriamne, if you were not Miriamne, I’d call you
Gabriel. I’m dazzled by these words. In truth, thy
‘<i>grail</i>’ is near, I believe.”</p>

<p>“That I seek to build up I’ve explained, and here in
Bethany I’ll attempt it. We’ll have a fraternity of women,
Christ-guided, with burning hearts, and in methods
simple, direct and catholic, reaching after women.”</p>

<p>“Now for our pillow prayer, Miriamne. Then side
by side, unto wondrous sleep land, side by side in heart
and being at awakening.</p>

<p>“‘The sun of the millennium will rise from behind
the family altar,’ Father Adolphus was wont to say.
’Twas well said; redeemed homes are the fruits of the
restoration. Shall I read to-night?”</p>

<p>“Surely we need the Word to understand the throbbings
of our own hearts when our prayers return,
dove-like, with olive branches from heaven.”</p>

<p>“What shall I read?”</p>

<p>“What came after Pentecost!”</p>

<p>Then the husband opened to the Gospel Story, and
remarking the ‘Ascension,’ read:</p>

<p>“He was taken up, after that He through the Holy
Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles
whom he had chosen:</p>

<p>“To whom also He shewed himself alive after His
passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them
forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the
kingdom of God:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>“When they therefore were come together, they
asked of Him, saying, Lord, wilt Thou at this time restore
again the kingdom of Israel?</p>

<p>“And He said unto them, It is not for you to know
the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put
into His own power.</p>

<p>“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy
Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses
unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria,
and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p>

<p>“And when He had spoken these things, while
they beheld, He was taken up; and a cloud received
Him out of their sight.</p>

<p>“And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven
as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in
white apparel;</p>

<p>“Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is
taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.”</p>

<p>“And His farewell happened at Bethany? It makes
our home seem still more like the gate of heaven, when I
remember this; ‘He’ll come so as He went;’ what if
that meant His next advent is to be at this very place?”</p>

<p>“Or, what if it meant that He would appear the
second time, in glory, at the homes of men; since He
elected His home for the gateway of His earthly
exit,” replied the husband. Then they sat for a
little while in a blessed silence; that kind that falls
upon souls bowing to a benediction, or moved by
thoughts that are holy beyond expression.</p>

<p>The wife broke in on their reverie: “I wonder how
His departure affected the disciples?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have it all here, darling;” then he took one of
his parchments and read:</p>

<p>“And He led them out as far as to Bethany, and He
lifted up His hands, and blessed them.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass, while He blessed them, He was
parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</p>

<p>“And they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem
with great joy:</p>

<p>“And were continually in the temple, praising and
blessing God.</p>

<p>“And they went forth, and preached everywhere,
the Lord working with them, and confirming the word
with signs following.”</p>

<p>“I knew it was as I thought! If believers are as
they say, enlisted soldiers, under the blood-stained
banners, our Christ has not been true to His word, or
there is universal treason in the camp! The world is
not gospeled and the soldiers have not the miracle
power. I tell you husband, there is need of a revolution,
a revival of zeal, an improvement of methods!
The Hospitaler was right. The Christian world needs
to be led along the <i>Via Dolorosa</i> after Jesus and Mary,
up to their measure of utter consecration, to their undying
love, to their lofty, soul consuming zeal!”</p>

<p>And the young gospel herald was silent, for he could
not gainsay her.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Miriamne, the heavenly host we imagined
to be in bivouac about our Bethany home,
methinks were really present, and gave color
and form to my dreams. I was in a grail-quest
all night.”</p>

<p>“What a golden day is such a night! But tell me
of the color and form of your visions, Cornelius.”</p>

<p>“We fell asleep last night conversing of the Ascension;
my dreams carried me on to Pentecost.”</p>

<p>“And what have you brought from the dream-land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
to help in the stern and pressing waking
hours?”</p>

<p>“A panting heart, as one having climbed mountain
above mountain. I burn to know and feel the whole
significance of Pentecost!</p>

<p>“I’ve determined to seek holy companionship and
wise guiding by attendance at the next ‘Harvest Feast’
at Jerusalem. I think I’ll get peculiar help at the great
city.”</p>

<p>“The Israelites will not welcome a Christian to their
feast.”</p>

<p>“The one I aim to attend is that that will be observed
by the Christian knights in an upper room, in the great
city. They think they have possession of the identical
apartment in which the disciples of our Lord met and
witnessed the glories of Pentecost, after the Ascension.”</p>

<p>“In Joseph of Arimathæa’s house?”</p>

<p>“That is the accepted report. The Hospitaler,
whom we believe to be a ‘Grail Knight’ of to-day, is
quite earnest in so affirming.”</p>

<p>“Wondrous white-souled Arimathæa! Jewish and
a priest, yet secretly a disciple of Jesus! I dare to
liken myself unto that holy man, in a measure. He
left an old faith for a new one, and followed the cup
of the Passion, as I, my ideal.”</p>

<p>“<i>A good man and a just</i>,” says the Testament.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“We meet to-night in Arimathæa’s house,” said the
Hospitaler to Cornelius, shortly after the arrival and
welcome of the latter at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“Can the uninitiated attend?” questioned Cornelius.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s the joy of it, they can; and more, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
are to have a number of Jews present, among them
some once priests; but now like that Joseph of blessed
memory, seeing the true light.”</p>

<p>“And the meeting?”</p>

<p>“The exalting of the Word, that’s the need of the
hour, world-wide. I tell thee, young man, set to teach;
the needs are not more religions but more religion, not
more revelators or prophets but surer interpreters. The
world blooms with truth on every hand; who will
pluck the blossoms?”</p>

<p>And the disciples were again, all with one accord,
in the holy upper chamber.</p>

<p>The Hospitaler, with an abruptness of John the Baptist,
merely throwing back his tunic and exposing the
golden sign of knighthood for a moment to his companions,
as he entered, at once began to address the
assembly;</p>

<p>“Jews and Gentiles, all children by creation of a
common Father—greeting! The fires of Pentecost are
kindled everywhere in Jerusalem, but they are the old
fires and cold enough; sacrifices smoke on the altars,
but the day of such offerings is past.</p>

<p>“Methinks, the offered bulls, goats and lambs, if they
could speak, would cry out against the priestly hands
that shed their blood; ‘How long, how long the blood
of our flocks has pointed to the lamb of God, the All-Savior,
who died to save men from sin and beasts
from the altar; and yet we die as if our work were not
finished!’</p>

<p>“The beasts join in the wailings of humanity.</p>

<p>“For centuries God’s chosen people celebrated this
feast of the harvest, the joy of Jewry; and now the
world’s harvest advenes. Yet, for the most part, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
multitudes see not the ripening. For years the first
fruits were offered, and as yet, the people do not understand
that first fruits mean chosen, choice fruits, the
elect of God.</p>

<p>“For centuries, Israel offered the shoulder and heart
of the lamb, and yet Israel waits under the overshadowing
smokes of its burnt offering, not discerning the
Lamb Priest, whose heart of eternal love and shoulder
of power, are given for the salvation of the people.</p>

<p>“Israelites, hear me; out of the altar’s smoke emerges
to view the kingdom of the house of David, refined, purified—the
hope of the future. Ye have thought, hitherto,
that David’s kingdom, whatsoever it might have
been, is, in these ages, to be reckoned with the dynasties
and forces of an antiquity, whose influences long ago
ebbed away along the shores of the all-entombing past.</p>

<p>“Yet such conclusion is as fallacious as it is evidently
superficial. The God who works in unbroken time
cycles, though men remit their tasks at the beck of sleep
or death, pushes forth His forceful, faultless projects
with a tireless consistency that knows no cross purposes.
A real and present kingdom is that with which
this Pentecost we have to do. We are not, <i>at that
time</i> when <i>they shall bring out the bones of the kings of
Judah and spread them before the sun</i>. David’s throne
is a verity, though long incrusted with neglects; it is a
symbol of power in a dynasty that is ordained to overspread
the earth. I’d summon my witnesses; first the
weeping Jeremiah. ‘Thus said the Lord: David shall
never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of
Israel.’ How bold! but amid the ruins about us, I cry
never! never! Now call the God-nourished captive
Daniel, who, sincere to the last, made all Babylon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
glow with his prayers and his visions. Saith Daniel:</p>

<p>“‘The God of heaven shall set up a kingdom
that shall never be destroyed.’ The dream is certain;
the interpretation sure. He was proof against
the alluring blandishments of his royal captors, and as
pure to the last as a knight of San Grail.”</p>

<p>Cornelius saw a light on the Hospitaler’s face, and
knew it was that that comes from a conscience clear
before God. The latter went on with a voice suddenly
become tenderer than it was before.</p>

<p>“Let us hear the reply of the converted pagan king,
Nebuchadnezzar: ‘<i>Whose kingdom is from generation
to generation!</i>’</p>

<p>“Hearken to Isaiah, to whom the scroll of human history
through a thousand generations then yet to come
was present and lucid: ‘Unto us a child is born ...
his name shall be called Wonderful ... The Prince
of Peace.’ ‘Of the <i>increase</i> of His government and
peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David
to <i>establish</i> it with judgment and with justice from
henceforth and <i>forever</i>.’ Surely he must be of dull
comprehension who saith this is only the spiritual,
heavenly kingdom of the glorified.</p>

<p>“Let us stand for a little under the light of the
blazing tongues of Pentecost, enswathed in imagination
by the mighty, rushing tide of Spirit manifestation,
fresh from the Being of the Almighty. Now listen
to Peter, transfigured and illuminated within and
without. Error here, with him, was impossible! Untruth
at such a time would be a madness like that of
the attempted steadying of the ark. Saith Peter: ‘<i>David
being a prophet knowing that God had sworn to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
that He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.</i>’ Peter
at last, a rock of God, I bless thee! Call that archangel,
who doth excel in strength, his name given him
in heaven being Gabriel, the ‘Champion of God.’ He
certified his mission to Mary in terms that can be
made no finer: ‘<i>I am Gabriel, that <span class="smcap">stand in the presence
of god</span> and sent to show thee glad tidings.
Thou shalt bring forth a son. And the Lord shall give
unto Him the throne of His father David.</i>’ Of His Kingdom
there shall be no end. These are ‘glad tidings,’
indeed, sung as such to the joy and wonder of heaven,
as well as proclaimed as the sovereign comfort of
earth’s inhabiters.</p>

<p>“The splendid, earthly Kingdom outlined so gloriously
by the prophets has suffered no syncope, and David’s
royal line has not found its end in sepulchral
palaces. That Kingdom and that line survives; their
zenith not yet attained.</p>

<p>“In that zenith day, <i>Truth shall spring out of the
earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven</i>.</p>

<p>“So it was settled forever in heaven, for earth and
to all eternity, that in the vocabulary of divine wisdom,
‘first-born’ means ‘choice-born.’ And he is choice-born
no matter how ill his beginning, who is reborn by
the all-uplifting, renewing Spirit of Grace! Jesus, in
marked manner, even in this respect, parallels David
in reäffirming in Himself this law of His refined, exalted
kingdom. The line of the Christ from remotest generations
is found to have deflected from the line of the
first born. His descent must be traced through Seth,
Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David, Solomon
and Nathan, and still others, none of whom were first
in their advent into the families to which they belonged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
Again, the Christ and his progenitor, David, antagonized
the barbarian tenet of all ages that a man was to
be honored merely because of his gigantesque figure or
prowess. In olden times men revered greatly the
giantly. Among the primitives to be a weakling was
to be pitiable, and to be huge to monstrosity was to be
respected, if not actually worshiped. Indeed, paganism
in its essence is but homage paid to the great, that
is terrible. The princely David began his career in
slaying wild beasts and monstrous giants, but we may
cease admiring the prowess he had physically in greater
admiration of the symbol that lies in his early exploits.
He was to be the giant-slayer; evil giants and giant
evils were to fall before him alike; and a shepherd’s
little sling, in pious hands, was shown to be invincible.
In Solomon’s time, there was more outward
splendor, but less spirituality than in David’s
time. The latter witnessed the gilded decline in its
beginnings. Decay followed swiftly. The world
sighed for a restoration; the heathen manufactured
gods; the Fire Worshipers followed stars; in the
groves, virgins were, after a sort, worshiped, as in
the forest night-services of the old England of some of
you, the Druids prayed to a mystical ‘virgin that was
to bring forth.’ There was a common yearning for the
coming of a Champion to lead and defend the races of
man. The yearning felt its way blindly toward the
wonder to be, that of a woman of the children of men,
mothering One all human, all divine, a Prince fit to link
together the parts of David’s kingdom, whether militant
here or triumphant above. That full day has
begun, but is only dimly seen by many. You Jews
have been wont to keep a Pentecost of males only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
while Egypt deifies a woman as goddess of the harvest.
One turns to brawn, the other to the bringer forth, and
neither gets the truth, the royal truth, found in the
faith that brings forth through all humanity!</p>

<p>“Would you see a real Pentecost? Now, look how
the first was to the fathers. The holy ones, among
Christ’s followers, believing His promises, assembled
at Joseph of Arimathæa’s house, to await it. Hear the
word:</p>

<p>“And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of
the disciples, the number of names together were about
a hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>“These all continued with one accord in prayer and
supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of
Jesus, and with his brethren.”</p>

<p>“Our holy Luke, said to have been an artist, artistically
presents the scene. As we read his record, we behold
the ‘Queen of the House of David,’ the representative
woman; as she should be, in the company and honor
of God’s people. Not there as a beautiful creature to
be admired; but there to pray with those who prayed
for the dawn and the glory. With the genius of an artist,
and the insight of a prophet, Luke displays his ideal
thus. The Scripture record closes, leaving the typical
woman amid God’s people, on her knees, waiting in
hopefulness for the full dawn; while for a little time
over all falls the earnest of the promise in miraculous
displays from above. There was a rushing of mighty
sounds, the providences of God in motion, the movements
of His spirits who minister, for a time made
visible! The scene was one never to be forgotten, and
the holy John, years after in the glowing visions of the
Apocalypse, had brought to his mind its central figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
the woman clothed with the sun; the transfigured
woman, and she as woman in her highest estate; that
is mothering a child! He saw her rising above all
perils, all evils; but as she rose, she bore aloft her
child, a Man Child! Look at the picture, men and
brethren, ’till it possesses your souls! <span class="smcap">Behold the
Woman!</span> Behold the interlaced symbols! As a mother
holds above peril her child, so the peerless woman
held aloft her Divine Babe; as the church holds aloft its
offspring, so also in the apotheosis of the ideal mother,
comes the uplifting of man’s hopes, and the triumph of
all that is best, all that is promised. We see to-day,
but the smoke side of Pentecost, by and by we’ll see,
as do those in heaven, its fire side.”</p>

<p>The speaker ceased his address, and all were filled

<p class="dropcap">“If I could only carry to Bethany what I feel
now!” ejaculated the young chaplain, as he
hurried along from the knights’ celebration
of Pentecost, homeward, at the time that the
Moslems were summoned to evening prayers by the
minaret calls.</p>

<p>After his greeting, on arriving at his abode, his first
words were: “I’ve seen the crowns of fire, and now
comprehend the meaning of Pentecost, where men
gathered from varied climes, heard each the spirit’s
message in his own tongue! The Spirit is the interpreter!”</p>

<p>“By what aid came this revelation?”</p>

<p>“God and the Hospitaler.”</p>

<p>“We have the first here; let us call the other, that
the temple on the hill be made to feel the glow. The
time is opportune, for each day witnesses new triumphs
of our cause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>When the knight arrived a feast was in progress.
His air awed those to whom he was a stranger, and
there were not a few who thought within themselves,</p>

<p>“Is he a prophet?”</p>

<p>Abruptly, as usual, he began:</p>

<p>“Friends: I would that all hearts here were moved
by justice to enthrone the Queen whose praise your
frank youths have been sincerely singing. I am here
to-day to proclaim her rights, and in so doing I shall
appeal to that sure word which survives when all else
fails. She was of David’s royal line; the noblest one
of all the earth. To the proof? The Christian Scriptures,
from the hands of Matthew and Luke, present
her ancestral descent. These apostles wrote as God
directed, and, after all, only reaffirmed that already set
forth in the most carefully, religiously guarded records
of all antiquity, the Jewish genealogical tables.</p>

<p>“You know that the ancient Jews held those tables
in sacred regard, for on their integrity depended the
proof of the things to them most dear, as they believed.
By them every Jew could trace his Abrahamic
descent, and to Abraham’s seed were all the great
promises of the covenant. By those tables they
proved their title to the land of promise, Canaan.
Every Jew, believing himself one of God’s chosen people,
and that his advancement and the advancement of
his posterity in the Divine favor, depended on the
purity of the blood of both, felt that he needed the
guidance of those tables to preserve him from any admixture
with alien or Gentile blood. The Aaronic
priesthood was hereditary and the priesthood was initial
in the religious system of the Hebrews. Its legitimacy
was preserved chiefly by these hereditary charters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
Then all true Israelites looked for the coming of
a Savior, Priest and King to bring to the chosen transcendent
glory, and to win an universal dominion,
marked by love, joy and peace. Every Jew knew that
Great One was to spring from the house of David, and
all within that Judaic line hoping that he or his children
might be near akin to the One to come, carefully,
constantly, proudly guarded and studied these records
of descent. Birth was the foundation upon which all
Jewish institutions were founded. ‘<i>So all Israel was
reckoned by genealogies.</i>’ They lived in a reign of blood,
and in blood to be Jewishly thoroughbred was, they
thought, to be most highly favored. They had not yet
discerned the law of the new dispensation, which declares
all men akin; a dispensation seeking to build up
a superior humanity by first of all transforming and
exalting the inner life. By the revered records of
these Jewish patriarchs, both holy and love-ladened,
place the writings of Matthew and Luke, and with concurrent
testimony, unimpeachable as well as conclusive,
the legitimacy of Jesus the son of Mary is proven!
He was beyond a cavil of David’s kingly line. There
were Christ-haters who contested at every point His
claim of Messiahship. They forged lies freely; they
hurled after Him slanders innumerable; they insinuated
that He was born in fornication; they affected
to flee from Him as one having a devil; they
denounced Him to Jewish as well as Roman authorities
as a liar, a seducer of men and a traitor. In a
word, they howled Him down in every way they could,
unabashed by the splendor of His baptismal indorsement,
unsilenced by the awful warnings of His cross.
But in their desperation they never dared to challenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
the records which proved Him ‘<i>the son of David</i>.’
Now had His claims rested upon His relations to His
earthly father, Joseph, they would have been disproven.
All Jewry would have quickly, fiercely proclaimed Him
a pretender and not in the family of promise. The
Christ was heir of David’s name and fame because His
mother was, and so in exalting Him you crown the
saintly woman who bore Him! He was the adopted
son of Joseph, type of all His followers, adopted sons
of a Royal Father. He was legitimate through his
mother, type of all his followers, brought into the
royal family of God by the power of a mystic new
birth.</p>

<p>“But there is another line running backward, preserved
through the centuries to connect the first Adam
with this last one. This line runs from Christ through
his mother to Eden. Behold the august truth suspended
by that chain of names! Names; only names
of the dead! names of the forgotten! Jesus by Mary
is linked to the chain! It’s an old, old chain, but yet
it has gems in its links. Each named is the child of
another living before, and the history of each is recorded
in two words, ‘begat,’ ‘died.’ A chain of dust!
One man precedes another. Each in turn vanishes
until immortality is confronted in the last sentence:
‘<i>Adam, who was the son of God!</i>’ The first mortal
son of God uncrowned and led away from his kingdom,
by a woman, to death! The twain go down together,
each ruinous to the other, with nothing left them but
a hope; and that hope rested upon a to them mysterious
promise: ‘<i>The seed of the woman shall crush the
head of the serpent!</i>’ It would have staggered their
faith had one told them that in God’s revenges, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
compensating, all healing, she that led down was of
the sex that should lead upward. Out of their darkness
there came a seeming dawn, and Eve cried ecstatically
at the birth of Cain:</p>

<p>‘I have gotten a man from the Lord!’</p>

<p>“They thought he was a token of renewed favor
and probably the redeemer from the curse. He turned
out a murderer, and introduced them to the supreme
horror of humanity—death. The conflict of light and
darkness went on, and the first pair tasted death themselves,
looking along the horizon of unrealized hopes
to the last and waiting, as all their posterity through
painful centuries waited, for the Man that was to save.
The long years with leaden tread marched on, struggles
amid suffering weighty and countless, accompanied
the race; of them all woman bore the heavier part, but
she kept somehow the larger hope. Each Jewish mother,
with a pride of sex secretly cherished, watched and
longed for the coming from herself of the ONE who was
to lift her up and crown her queen, indeed.</p>

<p>“God at last gathered all woman’s trustful hopings
into one great answered prayer, and deigning, in sovereign
love, His marvelous co-operation, brought forth
another and a perfect Adam.</p>

<p>“We are informed that Joseph and Mary went, about
the time of Jesus’ birth, in compliance with Roman
law, to Bethlehem to pay their personal taxes. The
Roman tax lists were based upon the records of family
descent so far as concerned the Jews.</p>

<p>“To make the collection certain beyond the possibility
of any one’s escape, the law required each taxable
subject to pay his allotted tribute in the city of his
nativity. The father and mother of Jesus were cited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
to the city of David. Thither they went. And so in
the providence of God it happened that pagan Rome
was summoned to the cradle of the infant Savior and
made unwittingly an attester to all time that He was
of a family by right recorded among those descended
from great David.</p>

<p>“The son and the mother here stand or fall together.
If Mary was not of David’s line, then the Son she bore
was not, and He is left without proof of being of the
seed of David.</p>

<p>“Joseph was not the father of the Christ <i>after the
flesh</i>. The lives of mother and son are eternally intertwined.
If we honor one we must needs honor the
other; abating the fame of one we degrade the other.</p>

<p>“Jesus’ claims to being the Messiah depended upon
the fact that His mother was of the tribe and family
royal. The absolute requirements of prophecy can
only be met in the Messiah by His being of the House
of David. Jesus himself admitted and fairly met this
necessity. So he questioned the Pharisees: ‘What
think ye of Christ? Whose son is he?’ ‘They say
unto him, the Son of David.’ Admitting this, the
Savior propounded the question involving sonship
and spiritual unity with God which His questioners
could not answer:</p>

<p>“‘If David then call him Lord, how is he son?’</p>

<p>“‘<i>Neither durst any man from that day forth ask
Him any more questions.</i>’</p>

<p>“Had He denied the necessity of Davidic origin they
could have overwhelmed Him with Scriptures. Had he
not been of that family the most ignorant Jew would
have promptly rejected His claims to being the Hope
of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>“Peter the apostle, amid the soul-trying solemnities
of Pentecost, speaking to the representatives of people
from all parts of the earth and for all time, cried:
‘Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you concerning
the Patriarch David: Being a prophet, and
knowing God had sworn with an oath to him that of
the fruit of his loins, <i>according to the flesh</i>, he would
raise up Christ to sit on his throne.’</p>

<p>“This orator spoke then with the accuracy of one in
the presence of the Holy Ghost, and not only made
sincere, but illuminated, by the torch of God. This
is conclusive, but the reiteratives of the inspired
writers justify us in presenting their cumulative
evidence.</p>

<p>“After Peter comes the learned Hebrew of the Hebrews,
Paul; before his conversion to Christianity declaring
himself to have been ‘after the most straightest
sect a Pharisee;’ after that conversion, rejoicing
to the end of life, as of the true, new Israel by faith in
Him that makest all new.</p>

<p>“Twice Paul met Mary’s son mysteriously, face to
face, within the very confines of Glory. Let Paul
speak: ‘Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, separated
unto the gospel of God, concerning His Son, our Lord,
which was made of the seed of David according to the
flesh!’</p>

<p>“Let us not longer make a mock of eternal, holy verities!
Christ was of David’s flesh through His mother,
and born to be a real king of a real kingdom, not a
phantom kingdom! That kingdom must come; yea,
blessed be Jehovah! it is coming.</p>

<p>“Joseph, the putative father of Jesus, adopted Jesus
as his son, but he could not, by that legal act, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
his foster son, whose father was the Holy Spirit of the
seed of David, <i>after the flesh</i>! Jesus received, then,
His royal blood from Mary, and bore His Kingly title
after the flesh as ‘<i>the crown wherewith his mother
crowned Him</i>.’ Revelations harmonize; Luke and
Matthew must therefore agree with Paul and Peter.</p>

<p>“The tables of Luke and Matthew agree down to
David’s time, but then they diverge, until they are
converged in Jesus, through the undoubted legitimacy
of Mary as a descendant of David and the adoption of
Jesus by Joseph, a scion of another branch of the same
great family. Luke gives a sentence, all luminous,
but first puzzling: ‘<i>Jesus himself began to be about thirty
years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph,
which was the son of Heli.</i>’ ‘Ah, as was <i>supposed!</i>’
sneers the infidel. ‘As was <i>supposed!</i> <span class="smcap">supposed!!</span>’
hatefully shouts some insinuating, ignorant Jews! But
now let us fill out, naturally, Luke’s statement, ‘as
was supposed, the son of Joseph, but in reality the son
of Heli.’ But here it may be asked, was Jesus the son
of Heli? It is, I answer, not infrequently in the Scriptures
that a grandson is called a son. Jesus was probably
the grandson of Heli. It was a common custom
of the Jews, except in cases of especial necessity, not
to record the names of women in tracing lines of descent.
Men kept the books, and it had become a habit
with the lords of creation to thrust woman into the
background. Mary was too insignificant a person,
socially considered, in her time, to be registered in her
own name in the hereditary charters. Joseph was put
in her stead, as her representative. There was not any
supposition about the descent of Mary, but these
scribes, who had charge of the books, thought it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
more creditable to the male sex to record Joseph as the
father of Jesus, and, by a little fiction, suppose him to
have descended through the former from Heli, than to
say Mary descended from Heli and Jesus descended
from Mary. The Romans encouraged this, and also the
politicians. Men were the only ones to fight or pay
taxes, and, as political factors, were strictly watched by
those in authority. Luke, in reality, gives Mary’s line.
He was scholarly and accurate, besides that a physician,
and we judge by all experience that there is that
in the profession of medicine which makes its followers
tender toward all suffering, consequently especially
tender to women, the largest inheritors of the pains
that beset our race. Doctor Luke, like those of his
fraternity, by an act of graceful justice, in the spirit
of Christianity which is essentially humane, just, and
courtly, accorded gladly the woman her place. But the
‘<i>doomsday books</i>’ of the Jews, containing their family
trees or genealogies, perished with the perishing of the
Jewish nation. Those records had done their work;
it was time for them to go. They had become by misuse
agencies of evil. They stood long enough to demonstrate
that God works through cycles vastly wide, and
that His definite promise made to Adam, Abraham and
many of their successors, had finally been fulfilled, at
the end of thousands of years, with a miraculous explicitness.
The records disappeared after Christ came,
and herein was a providence saying to the watchers:
‘He is come. No need further of the patents of His
ancestry to aid your watching.’ More than that, they
being gone, no other could arise claiming to be Shiloh,
with hope of convincing any by appeal to proof from
the records of ancestry.</p>

<p>“Shiloh and his white kingdom have come. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
ruling the earth; not in memories of its mighty dead,
but by its regal, potent virtues and charities. The
battering rams of Titus destroyed wall and Holy Temple,
but thus was let in new dawn. Above the storm
of that awful conflict the spiritual may discern in living
letters the mightly words of God which dispelled disordering
darkness from the universe at the beginning:
‘<i>Let there be light</i>,’ and, indeed, ‘light was.’ The
obliterated records of Jewish ancestral lines, on which
alone many a worthless child of Abraham based his
claims to superiority, his right to despise and neglect
his fellow men, his justification to tyrannize, and finally
his hope of favor with God, ceased to present their
sturdy barriers to the entering in of a better hope.
Then came in the beginning of this new era; now the
patent of nobility is noble character; this is the time
to be marked by an universal recognition of universal
brotherhood in a kingdom where there is neither Jew
nor Gentile, bond nor free, male nor female. A kingdom
where righteousness, impartial justice, liberty,
equality, purity and humanity are to be the regnant
potencies. In this kingdom, how fittingly, Christ
stands as the king and ideal of man, and how fittingly
his mother supplements his sway by being presented
herself to all womankind as a queenly ideal. Let him
or her dispute her title, who can surely say the earth,
in this redemption period, needs no such sublime epitome
of womanly virtue and worthfulness.</p>

<p>“My words are ended for to-day, assembled men and
women. Some of these things spoken may seem like
deep sayings, but I leave them to find their lodgment
in your hearts and minds. I trust them, knowing that
Truth has a sword which cuts her way, each sweep of
that sword making light.”</p>

<p>“The same authority that these growing shrubs and

<p>“Yes, the Grail song, ‘<i>Faint though pursuing</i>;’ the
dedication has commenced.”</p>

<p>The words sung recited the grail quest; but its
chorus, a simple one, was much the same as that sung
at the May-day festivities on a former occasion. The
people gathered, heartily joined in the chorus. When
the singing ceased, the Knight, in his usual abrupt
manner, began addressing the assembly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The beloved young missioners have undertaken, by
means of their handiwork here, to strikingly present the
noblest truths, and they have taken a step in the right direction.
Love for the pictorial, manifest especially in children,
grows with growth; those adult needing and seeking, as
they grow, finer, grander symbols. Our Divine Lord, who
‘<i>knew men</i>’ and ‘<i>knew</i> what was in man,’ did not rebuke, but
rather utilized this taste of man, by teaching the profoundest
things of His Kingdom by means of it. He came as
close as close could be to the very core of human life, as it
was or to all time will be. While He might have navigated
Galilee in a palatial barge, borne over be-flowered waves by
perfumed breezes and golden wings, with the aureoled
spirits, ‘<i>who do excel in strength</i>,’ by thousands, to escort
Him, He chose rather to journey in an all-winning humility,
borrowing, as He had need, the old boat of some poor
Tiberian fisherman. He might have entered Jerusalem,
that last time, in an Elijah-like chariot, dazzling the city
with splendors surpassing those that the rapt John beheld
on Patmos; but the King of Glory, seeking to be the King of
all men, elected in that supreme moment to get near to
men by approaching the august courts of Herod and Caiphas,
and the commons as well, on an ass—an humble beast, and
borrowed at that. All this allegorized the condescension
and sympathy of Jehovah. The universe is full of patterns!
The books of Nature, Revelation, and Providence, having a
common authority, are constant in the use of pictured
truth. Nature gives us the dawning of light and the marshaling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
of order out of darkness and chaos. There is the
low earth, the high firmament, ripe summer going down into
the winding sheets of winter and up to the resurrections
of spring. Twig, flower, seed, forest; insect that creeps,
and bird that flies; the speck-life moved, and the behemoth;
the atom and the planet-system—waning and
growing, dying and living, from formlessness to beauty, from
time to eternity! Then take the inspired picture-history:
Eden’s fall, Egyptian captivity, the Red Sea passage, the
wilderness, the manna by the way, the rest by the Mount of
the Law, the entrance to the Promised Land. Lastly, the
Incarnate One, an eternal symbol, the realization and fulfillment
of all preceding. ‘Which things are an allegory,’ exclaimed
Paul, with a sweeping back-look. The three books
present to the thoughtful pictured banners innumerable, to
wave him onward. This temple is dedicated to the purpose
of pointing to these pictures. Fitly the ‘angels of the
mount’ have determined to make prominent the beautiful,
patient, modest Mary, Mother of Jesus. And to study her
intelligently or profitably, it is necessary to know her not only
as an historical personage, but as one in the cavalcade of
symbolism unfolded by Sacred Writ and by Nature. She
passes by, herself every way unique, the exemplar of God to
those aspiring after gentle, devout girlhood, pure and wise
maiden-life, constant wifehood, and patient, consecrated,
and influential motherhood. Turn again to the Divine
Word, the beacon of the ages, the history of Providence,
the solver of life’s problems. It is made up of
an entrancing array of symbols, types, prophetic dramas,
and gorgeously constructed visions, constantly representing
or dextrously pointing, by countless trophies and allegories,
to its Ideal and Darling, Mary’s Son, <i>who ‘spoke as
man never spake, yet who without a parable spake nothing.’</i>
Though the literary ages are strewn with long winrows of
dead books, no work of man long surviving the mutations
of time, God’s picturesque handiwork, the inspired volume,
as potently molds the thoughts, charms the affections and
quickens the hopes of our race with its tokens, types, idyls
and illustration as it did when the earth was younger by far
than it is now. It is a living fountain, not only giving, but
retaining its immortality! It abides because it masterfully
deals with the things that pertain to the wonderland of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
soul. How necessary its methods is at once apparent to
any one who considers, discerningly, man as a complex union
of spirit and matter; wonderful forever, but ‘<i>very good</i>,’
since the All Holy, Great High Priest performed the nuptial
ceremony of that union. If there could be found a being
able to reason, as a man, who had not within himself this
unity, and who had never experienced its phenomena, such
would at once combat the possibility of its existence. Even
those so organized, and momentarily realizing the jointure
of the God-like spirit with the earthly body, the higher condescending
to and communing with the inferior, the inferior
at times over-persuading, dominating and utterly shipwrecking
its great spiritual co-partner, are compelled to
admit the whole as being a fact without parallel, alike inscrutable
and bewildering. A life-time of profoundest introspection
can carry the greatest mind, herein, only to the
confines of new wonders. But the interest in the study of
the unwritten, unvoiced language of symbolisms by which
the wonderfully united twain, soul and body, confer and
commune with each other deepens with the study. What a
fine, expressive, rapid, exact, exalted language that must
be! To each well understood; without their arcana unknown,
unheard, incomprehensible. And it is of necessity
all symbol, natural, intuitive, without a single arbitrary sign!
This sign-language acts by <i>symbol</i> in the royal temple of
memory and imagination. And so again we perceive the
representative, picturesque or typical is the medium of the
fine, the deep and the lofty in expressing truth. This is the
soul’s language, by which it communes with whatever else
there is in man, through which it receives the songs of
Heaven, and the august or tender messages of the Spirit, out
of the deathless land.</p>

<p>“When this sphere of ours was rolling swiftly onward
through the shadows of night, as well as swiftly downward
through darker shadows of sin, Divine love said ‘Let there be
light.’ Then the hosts of heaven saw at Bethlehem a
mother and babe marking the place of world-dawn, unfolding
the design of Deity to effect redemption by touching the
race of man at infancy; the most effective because the most
plastic point; through motherhood the most influential because
the tenderest instrumentality. The never-to-be-forgotten
spectacle thrilled, with a new ecstasy, the beings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
glory whose every throb of life is joy. They tracked the
heavens about with light as they sped out to keep abreast
the fleeing earth and shout over Bethlehem, ‘Glad tidings!
Glad tidings!’ They saw Eden restored through the advent
of a new, pure home; they saw a mystic covenant between
God and man typified in the child begotten of a human
mother in conjunction with the Eternal Father. By this there
seemed to be an attesting that humanity was to be raised to
Divine favor; there also was a symbol showing the value of
law; for through the incarnation, Deity, in the form of a babe,
became submissive to law administered by a mortal mother.</p>

<p>“He is blind who can not see in all these things God’s purpose
to elect some of His creatures to be His co-laborers in
the choicest co-operations, and also to be exemplars of what
He does and would do. These things being so, we do well
to learn the alphabet of His goodness from His elect heroes,
heroines and saints; and I proclaim to-day my innermost
belief in Christ as the argument, logic and fruit of God’s
love; but, at the same time, I praise, as one enravished,
the character of her who was God’s poem, God’s peroration!
We now proclaim this temple dedicated to the purposes
of showing forth the things I have spoken.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Hospitaler abruptly ceased his address, as he began
it. There were other services consisting of psalm-singing
and prayers, and the service was ended.</p>

<p>As the congregation dispersed, the young missioner,
Cornelius, exclaimed: “Miriamne, the Hospitaler has
awakened me as from sleep by God’s truth. Oh, the
heavens are not as full of shining stars as God’s truth
is full of beauty! It seems strange that men like myself,
and wiser, are so long in bringing these things to
their minds. You, my dear little mystic, are my interpreter.</p>

<p>“It’s just as I told you, wife. We must go in pairs.
In the Egyptian mythologies, Osiris had his Isis,
Amen-Ra his Maut, and Kneph his Sate. Thank
God I have my adolescent other self!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>“I, a woman, help you? My sex is honored by the
praise. Are they worthy of all they need? Is it
madness to seek to gather all women having gifts and
needs into a helped and helping fraternity whose creed
is a fine example? If I help Cornelius, cannot a peerless
one like Mary help all?”</p>

<p>“Pardon the thought, but one word haunts me—idolatry!”</p>

<p>“Impossible! We all need soul company, and have
room within for such. We must have an inner population
of real heroines and heroes or be filled with
ghosts and myths. The empty soul, eaten up with
self-worship, goes mad; the myth-possessed becomes
an idolater. If we harbor the God-like, keeping the
highest place for Deity, our inner selves will be no
hideous chambers of imagery, but a counterpart of
heaven.”</p>

<p>“But some have fallen into putting Mary before
Jesus, and so we’ve seen the advent of Mariolatry.”</p>

<p>“But this only, and surely, here I know, no friend of
the Divine Son can dethrone Him by honoring her,
aright; indeed, as He, Himself, did. It was of Him
she spoke when exclaiming: ‘<i>My soul doth rejoice in
God my Savior!</i>’ Can one truly honor Him and
despise and ignore the woman who gave Him human
birth? Can one have His mind and forget her for
whom love was uppermost to Him in His supreme last
hours? Can one honor her aright, and yet dethrone
the Son whom she enthroned? She bore Him, then
lived for Him. She honored herself in bearing Him,
and was His mother, His teacher and His disciple.
He revered her, she worshiped Him. Awed by His
augustness, she was yet conscious of an ownership of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
His greatness; believing in His divinity, she yet enjoyed
the nearness to Him of a mother.”</p>

<p>“I can not but believe that she is a queen, indeed,
high among the glorified who reign with God! I question
again: Who ever did, or could, become heretic or
carnal by sincerely revering the peerless woman whom
Christ enthroned on His heart?”</p>

<p>“I know at least that the fathers at imperial and pagan
Rome placed a representation of Mary in their
Pantheon when public policy made it an imperative
necessity to overthrow the influence of the lewd, fanciful
and ungodly ideals that had been set up therein,”
responded Cornelius.</p>

<p>“The world is a Pantheon full of corrupt ideas. Let
us raise high the choice ones God has sent us—But
see, yonder is the wife of a poor old Druse camel-driver.
She was once a sinner in the streets of Jerusalem.
Now she is a Sister of Bethany, allured to goodness by
our Temple’s allegories!”</p>

<p>“A woman that was a sinner, a scarlet woman?”</p>

<p>“Only such. No; all of that! One woman; a lost
one? How little to man; how much to God! Had
nothing else been done, heaven would have been set
singing, as ever, over a sinner’s return. That’s reward
enough for all we’ve attempted.”</p>

<p>“Now I’m interested, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Well you may be, when you hear all. We’ve here one
once a harem beauty, who, having lost her power to
fascinate, was committing her life to that hag-cunning
belonging to old women who supplement their decaying
power by wickedness, fox-like and serpentine.”</p>

<p>“The old, old story; yet I thank God if her life be
sweetened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hers is a strange story.”</p>

<p>“May I know it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is, as I’ve gathered it in scraps, a sad
romance. She was born of Georgian parents, among
the mountains of Armenia, and gifted, in her youth,
as are most of those of her sex in that country, with unusual
personal beauty. She early attracted the attention
of the monsters who dealt in human flesh, and a
Georgian noble unrighteously claiming her family as
his serfs, bartered away Nourahmal to merchants seeking
recruits for Mameluke harems. She became, in
time, part of the retinue of a sheik by the name of
Azrael, a desperate adventurer, who, on account of his
blood-deeds, was called by his followers the ‘Angel of
Death,’ His luxurious and desperate way of living
justified his claim to Turkish extraction; his adroitness
and avidity for intrigue stamped him as a Mameluke.”</p>

<p>“Nourahmal? Azrael? Why, these must be the
same of whom I’ve heard Sir Charleroy speak?” queried
Cornelius.</p>

<p>“The same!”</p>

<p>“She comes out of the past as one from the dead!”</p>

<p>“And her story is a series of strange events. It is
as follows: Azrael suspected her of having abetted
the escape of my father and Ichabod, therefore determined
to kill her. She gained a temporary respite
through having saved her master’s life from an assassin
plotting to supplant him; though she periled her
own in so doing.</p>

<p>“As Azrael awaited her recovery from the wounds
she had suffered in his behalf, he devised another scheme
which he hoped would compass his favorite’s destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
and his own elevation. He was ambitious to be
Sherif of Mecca. To attain that honor he saw he
must needs do something to enhance his popularity
greatly with his Mohammedan followers, and so conceived
the plan of getting into his power, Harrimai of
the Jews and Adolphus of the Christians. His purpose
was to rack those two leaders into apostasy and the
betrayal of their followers. Had he succeeded, the
event would have been crushing to Jews and Christians
east of Jordan. He promised Nourahmal her freedom
and restoration to her Georgian home if she aided him
in his design; though he did not disclose his purpose
to her beyond that of securing the presence of Von
Gombard and Harrimai in his camp. She felt that
there was some malign, hidden purpose in her master’s
breast, but deemed it expedient, at the outset, to seem
to co-operate in his plan.”</p>

<p>“But how was the sheik using his strategy against
Nourahmal?”</p>

<p>“As a fiend! He, having no conception of a friendship
between a man and a woman that was pure and
free from intrigue, suspected the relations between his
favorite and Ichabod. He thought the two only
needed the opportunity to precipitate into perfidy. He
laid his plan darkly, and, leaving a trusty follower to
carry it out, hastened forward to Mecca.”</p>

<p>“But surely, Nourahmal was not what he thought
her!”</p>

<p>“No; though training her as a plastic child, he judged
she was what he had tried to make her; at her worst she
was. But let me continue. The assault on my parents
and Ichabod, on the road between Gerash and Bozrah,
was the opening of the drama. The plan then was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
seize Rizpah, and under pretense of negotiating for her
ransom, inveigle Harrimai into the hands of Azrael’s
followers. Nourahmal was to aid in this by affecting
tears, pleading for pity and suggesting the sending for
the girl’s father.”</p>

<p>“What besetments perilous we pass through, all
unknown to us! Harrimai and your parents, to their
death, never suspected the devices worked against
them!”</p>

<p>“Nor dreamed that a harem favorite, a mere girl,
and an utter stranger to them, was their good
angel!”</p>

<p>“Good angel! How?”</p>

<p>“She witnessed the assault from behind a sequestering
wall, in company with a follower of the sheik, commissioned
to kill her instantly if she faltered in the
part appointed her. This infernal guard was also
charged to insinuate into her mind the feasibility of
elopement with Ichabod. If she could be compromised,
Azrael knew he could justify her death to those
who remembered her heroic defense of himself. That
was to follow as soon as she had done her part in inveigling
Harrimai to Azrael’s camp.”</p>

<p>“A demonstration of a personal devil, Miriamne.”</p>

<p>“I’d say rather of an overruling God.”</p>

<p>“How fared Nourahmal after Azrael’s chagrin?”</p>

<p>“Cornelius anticipates me. When she saw Ichabod
fall, a sudden desire for liberty for herself and to help
the imperiled Rizpah, prompted her to drive a dagger
into the heart of her guard and cry, ‘Rescuers come!’
That cry drove the remnants of the assailers of Sir
Charleroy to sudden flight. She asserted to the fugitives
that Laconic, the new runner, just passing, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
slain her guard, and so allayed suspicion until opportunity
of escape came. She soon made her way to
Bozrah, where she found among the Christians a temporary
home. From thence she drifted into Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“’Twas strange she did not turn toward Gerash.”</p>

<p>“I said as much to her, but desire to get as far as
possible from Azrael, and as near as possible to the
Holy City, of which Ichabod had so glowingly spoken
to her, determined her course; besides that, Ichabod
being dead, Gerash was a strange place to her—Jerusalem
seemed to her, she said, near heaven.”</p>

<p>“Had she only known it, she was near heaven in
Bozrah, being near Von Gombard.”</p>

<p>“Her story weaves a chaplet for his tomb to-day;
for now it appears that from Nourahmal the old priest
foreknew the intention of those Saracens, who assailed
the city that day I was with him. Though they designed
capturing him to put him on the rack, he rushed into
the conflict, crying, ‘Kill the foe with kindness!’ The
assault would have been fatal to Bozrah, too, had not
the leader of one of the invading bands ordered a retreat,
just at the point of victory. This was indirectly
Nourahmal’s work; for that leader had been won by
her to esteem Christians far enough to be unwilling to
murder them, though not adverse to plundering them.
That was a great improvement in a Mohammedan.”</p>

<p>“And Nourahmal knows from you that you are Sir
Charleroy’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by that I won her confidence. Indeed, she
began this confidence at first, by saying, ‘I love you,
because you so remind me, angel of the mount, of a
Christian knight, who was the dear friend of the only
pure and unselfish man I knew in all my youth! Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
words led to questions and explanations. The rest you
know.”</p>

<p>“And you have allured, comforted and enlightened
her?”</p>

<p>“By God’s help, I have. I have told her of the universal
sisterhood, of all women, who take as their exemplar
the worthy mother of the One who proclaimed
the universal brotherhood of man. This knowledge is
her joy and inspiration. When I am with her, she
never tires of hearing of the ‘Queen of David’s House,’
the mother of mothers.”</p>

<p>“But how have you allured her hither, Miriamne?”</p>

<p>“You have questioned curiously with your eyes, at
least, concerning those gated alcoves and curtained
balconies in our Temple of Allegory. They helped
her!”</p>

<p>“Since you say they are not ‘Confessionals,’ as I call
them, tell me what they are?”</p>

<p>“‘Rock clefts’ our sisterhood calls them; some are
doors to little adjacent chapels; some are quiet resting
places, where, in impressive solitude, souls in prayer
may find the mountain manna, for which the Savior
sought in many a lone night-watching; and some are
places where are presented, under entrancing symbols,
exalting truths.”</p>

<p>“Words have failed to turn the world to faith:
may signs do better.”</p>

<p>“I’ve put truth into visible form, that they who get
it here may learn that truth thus is only up to its full
might. I’d have my followers believe in visible, not
phantom, truth; so believing, truth will not be a ghostly
proclamation, the toy of the mind, but a force moving
hands and hearts!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you have met Nourahmal’s case?”</p>

<p>“Yes; fully in what we call the ‘Lover’s Bower,’
yonder. Remember she has been the victim of mock
love, from first to last.”</p>

<p>“The ‘Lover’s Bower’?”</p>

<p>“Behold the trophy and the bower! There is Nourahmal,
now rapturously contemplating the picture of
Joseph putting the ring of espousal on the hand of the
Virgin Mary.”</p>

<p>“Nourahmal? That gray-haired, hard-faced woman,
holding the hand of a charming girl?”</p>

<p>“That is Nourahmal; the younger woman is Beulah,
her grand-daughter; they two are almost inseparable
now.”</p>

<p>“An oleander by a limestone cliff! And so she
takes her station by a scene of betrothal, forgetting that
hymen’s altars can be fired by youth alone!”</p>

<p>“The world says so; but yet a disappointed life may
sometimes learn why it has been a failure, by studying
the ashes of time gone in the light of quickened
memories.”</p>

<p>“What finds Nourahmal there?”</p>

<p>“Golden lessons. First for her grand-daughter, her
idol. She never tires of saying before yon picture to
that maiden now her charge: ‘My flower, my lamb,
be always as pure as the espoused of Joseph, and you
will be a jewel which your husband, if he be a true
man, will ever proudly wear on as his heart. My flower,
my lamb, no woman should leave all for any man,
unless she is certain of finding in him father, mother,
brother, sister, companion, as Mary found in Joseph!’”</p>

<p>“But how did these things bless Nourahmal herself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>“Love counterfeited, blasted her life. She believed
that it was only gross passion masquerading in attractive,
delusive colors. So believing, it was difficult to tell
her of the Love of God so she could realize its wealth.
Love was only great selfishness, excited and persistent,
to her mind. It was something to teach her that the
genuine affection was utterly otherwise; in fact the
foundation and crown of all the noblest sentiments implanted
by God in His choicest creations.</p>

<p>“I have sought to allegorize here, true affection in all
its perfection. It seems to be fitting to do so, for my
ideal queen was ruled by it. She never could have
loved to the depths she did, as a mother, if she had not
had within her being all the possibilities of woman’s love.
And in a rightly balanced woman love is all-impressive,
all-controlling; with her worship is loving and loving is
worship. Here I shall seek to refine that sentiment in
the hearts of my sisters until each becomes an evangel in
its behalf. Then mankind will understand the wealth
a woman bestows on the man that wins her. There
is nothing in her career that surpasses it, except that
sovereign act wherein she lays herself a convert on
God’s altar. I am seeking to exalt this sacred act, the
loving of the gentler sex, until all men, brought to
revere it as they ought, shall become true knights; until
society shall be of one mind in crying traitor to every
man that contemns it in wedlock, and ready to lash
naked around the world every betrayer who awakens it
in innocency to lead it astray.”</p>

<p>“I can only again exclaim, oh! how full of flowers
and honey is my Miriamne’s creed and gospel!”</p>

<p>“And the churchman so exclaims because I’ve put
love where God put it, at the front of religion’s cohorts!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
Can there be a religion worth the name that does not
masterfully meet the requirements of the relations most
sacred between human beings?”</p>

<p>As she spoke she led her husband under the splendid
painting of Joseph espousing Mary, toward the entrance
of the bower, remarking: “This vestibule, from
the Roman word Vesta, Goddess of Purity, is suggestive.
Rome placed Vesta among the household gods,
and was wont to have an altar at every outer door. If
Purity guard the door, Light and Love will dwell within.
See the laurel, emblem of victory, as the ancients put
it by Purity’s altar; so do I. Love, when pure, is all-victorious!”</p>

<p>“Miriamne, these old truths seem to me very charming
as you now present them; but can Nourahmal and
others like her enter into their meaning?”</p>

<p>“A pious saint of our church says that the star which
guided to Bethlehem finally sank into a spring, where
it may be yet seen by women if they be pure.”</p>

<p>As they thus communed he passed through an
arched doorway, and was admitted to a grand court,
three sides of which were inclosed by the temple and
two of its wings, the fourth side hedged by palms,
vine-interlaced. The sky was the roof, the carpet the
floor of that country. Just in front of the palm-hedge,
on a grassy hillock, conspicuous beyond all else, was
a colossal stone face. It seemed as if it had emerged
from the earth, bald of all life—desolation expressed in
mute stone.</p>

<p>“Astarte here!” exclaimed Cornelius.</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s part of my Bashan inheritance, from
Kunawat, the land of Job.”</p>

<p>“A woman and a devil beset him; (the two are in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
face, methinks). Its hideousness, as its import, seems
inappropriate in Love’s Bower.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tis hideous now, though once the face had
beauty. It is not futile for young-love to remember
that time gouges deformity into beautifulness, nor for
all to remember how the Kings of the East in Moses’
time overthrew the Rephaim, the fallen giant followers
of the goddess. The East is the home of light, and
light is fateful to evil lives. Where are the Astarte-devotees
now?”</p>

<p>As the man listened his eyes wandered to the place
where the palm grove came up against the temple
wing, and there he observed a purling ribband of water.</p>

<p>“Cornelius sees my poem of silver. It comes from
a grove of cedars and sharon roses, out of a spring in
the bosom of a hill. Look the other way. It passes
under the alcove, under the temple wall; a short, dark
passage brings it to liberty, ending in the Virgin’s
Pool of Kidron. The sun allures it up to the clouds
at last. But listen; it sings as it runs!”</p>

<p>“I hear many blending melodies.”</p>

<p>“Do you see that canopied dais? There the instructor,
or preacher if you will, stands. The stream
passes near it, getting impulse by a fall; true love is
speeded when it runs by truth. That’s my lesson.
Then there are Æolian harps this side and that of the
dark alcove, the latter the type of the tomb.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“True love has music both sides of the grave.”</p>

<p>“Mystic!”</p>

<p>“Interpreter, say.”</p>

<p>“But I hear the songs of birds?”</p>

<p>“There they are, this side the dark exit: but in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
cage, supported above the current by an hour-glass and
sickle.”</p>

<p>“Grim emblems.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it’s a grim truth that love’s joy notes here
are caged, hampered and transitory. The hour-glass
and sickle are, when those notes are sung, ever.</p>

<p>“Look to the West.”</p>

<p>“I look, and see nothing but the picture of a sunset.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that curtains the ‘Rest of the Aged’ in
our temple.”</p>

<p>“But whither am I led by these words?”</p>

<p>“Led to look toward sunset, for morning, by faith.
You remember the Christ was never old; neither are
they who draw their life from Him. The ‘Ancient of
Days’ not only has, but gives, eternal youth. Oh, there
were young men at His sepulcher; yet those angels
could count their years by centuries! Let the hour-glass
make record and the sickle reap; the passion
flower recalls a vernal life, where the oldest saints are
the youngest, where all existence is growth, refreshment,
glory, exultation! There, love is law and law is
love, and to love is to live and to live is to love. We
get a breath of this life here as we enter the vicinage
of the immortal pair, Jesus and Mary; and we get a
distant view of the whole from the mountains of the
gospel.”</p>

<p>“I believe, and yet sometimes start back at the
question, ‘What if, after all, at the end almost of eternities
there come monotony, decadence, satiety—death?’
Next after hell, and nigh as horrible, is annihilation;
and worst of all, eternal existence with nothing
for which to strive—a living death!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>

<p>“They say, that in Egypt, a palm bowed to give shade
to the mother, Mary; while the aspen refused to her
any comfort. Then Christ blessed the palm and it
became the fruitful evergreen, while the aspen leaf is
fated to the end of time by constant tremblings to
betoken the agues of a cursed life. But, under the sun
in submission, our aspen lives are turned to palms!
We, having His life, need never tremble at death, for
we shall ever throb with a loving like His.”</p>

<p>“But there are many conditions and needs to womankind.
Let us speak of these, since the present is hers,
the future God’s.”</p>

<p>“The knights vainly tried swords; my King promised
to draw all men to Himself. You told me how Sir
Galahad, the pure knight, had made, about the Holy
Grail, when he found it, a chest of precious stones
and gold. Now, I’ve found the virgin pattern of perfection,
representative of the human-like beating heart
of God. Here I’ve set her, exalted her. This shall be
her golden precious palace. Though dead, here shall
be presented in the grandeur of her character, the
sweetness of her power. By and by, it may come about
that all mankind akin, shall make it the chief duty of
Church and State, to care, with a loyal tenderness, for
all women, all children, from first and last; that not one
such shall be left miserable. That will be the world
obeying the Crucified’s, ‘Behold thy mother.’”</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Virgin Mary</span> unquestionably holds forever a peculiar
position among all women in the history of redemption. Perfectly
natural, yea, essential to a sound religious feeling, it is to associate
with Mary, the fairest traits of maidenly and maternal character,

<p class="dropcap">“There’s a footman at the door; the good
man that talks, I think; he would speak
with Cornelius.”</p>

<p>With such words, at sunrise one morning
a few weeks after the May-day service, the missioners
of Bethany were aroused by an attendant. Quickly
robing himself, the young chaplain went forth, and,
sure enough, the Hospitaler stood before him.</p>

<p>“Selamet; but what haste brings our ever-welcome
friend so early?”</p>

<p>“To relieve your minds! I’ve purchased immunity!
The Mameluke sheik, at Jerusalem, has secured the
Sultan’s revocation of the order of razing and banishment,”
answered the knight. Cornelius gazed at the
Hospitaler with anxiety, questioning within himself as
to whether the knight had taken leave of his reason or
not.</p>

<p>The abrupt soldier-priest perceiving the perplexity
of his hearer broke forth: “Why the edict that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
Temple on the hill be despoiled, and the ‘Angels of
the Mount’ be summarily driven out of Syria, has been
rescinded; the ‘Faithful,’ as those infidels style themselves,
have been converted; seen a great light which
came by mighty gold.”</p>

<p>“All Saints defend us! I did not hear of this. Tell
me all!” exclaimed Cornelius.</p>

<p>“Not now; the peril is past. I knew it was impending
sometime, and supposed ye did. I promised
a reward, if time were given. I got money help
from foreign knights. The vandals took it with a
mighty thirst, and then with a great show of piety
promised toleration.”</p>

<p>“I see, as usual with them, great gain with godliness
is contentment; but what are we on the mount
to do?”</p>

<p>“Go on; the Sultan isn’t God, nor his sheik the
Devil.”</p>

<p>“The Hospitaler comforts. Now let us enter and
breakfast together, that we may get wisdom by conferring.”</p>

<p>“I may not tarry longer; I staid all night without
the city’s wall so as not to be delayed by awaiting the
gate-opening. I must be with my companions by the
time the Moslems have ended their first prayers, or my
comrades will be alarmed. I’ll return to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Another dawn, another noon, and another sunset,
came and went; but the knight did not reappear at
Bethany. The chaplain vainly tried to suppress his
anxiety. He feared some treachery on the sheik’s
part. Again and again the former went to the house-top
to look along the Jerusalem road. It was a hot
June day; the watchings flushed the young man’s face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
but fears’ rigors in the heart paled it. He was a
picture of misery. Darkness followed sunset; then
came tidings:</p>

<p>“There’s a company with garlands and torches coming
around the bend!”</p>

<p>The news was brought by a company of Sisters of
Bethany. The missioner was excited, yet reasoned:</p>

<p>“Garlands and torches! Their bearers can not have
baleful report nor evil designs.”</p>

<p>The visitants quickly arrived, and singing a roundelay,
encircled the house of Cornelius and Miriamne.
With delight the latter recognized the Hospitaler and his
companion knights. With them were a number of the
friends of the new movement at Bethany. They also
observed, standing by his camel, a little aloof, a tall,
gaunt man, garbed as a Druse; by him, an elderly woman,
and also a maiden.</p>

<p>“’Tis Nourahmal and her grand-child!” whispered
Miriamne, following her husband’s questioning eyes.</p>

<p>“The maiden wears the flower crown of a bride, and
see, there is a young man by her side!”</p>

<p>The Hospitaler interrupted their converse:</p>

<p>“I’ve kept my promise to the ‘Angels of the Mount’
and to God. I’m here, and to celebrate a proper
thanksgiving!”</p>

<p>“Welcome! Now command us,” exclaimed Miriamne.
“Yea, welcome, though coming in mystery!”</p>

<p>“Another surprise, good chaplain? Well, ’tis fitting,
since this one is cheering. There was need of
offset to thy painful astonishment of yesterday. I’ve
trapped a wolf for our festivities.”</p>

<p>“A wolf!” exclaimed Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Yes, even the sheik. He swore that he’d make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
all Bethany bald by fire and sword if it were attempted
here to establish a Christian church. To
him I explained that the work on the hill was festal.
Praise God, it is to be such, to all eternity! And
Miriamne’s disavowal of the title church, the use of
the appellations ‘Pool of Bethesda,’ ‘House of Mercy,’
‘Temple of Allegory,’ and the like, by your followers
in the city, concerning your place of gathering, helped
the righteous diversion. I finished the argument by
parading with my cortege, as you see us now. Indeed
I even asked the sheik to come to the wedding!”</p>

<p>“A wedding?”</p>

<p>“The cruel sheik invited?”</p>

<p>“Two questions and two questioners to be answered
with more surprises. Nourahmal’s grand-daughter,
Beulah, is to be joined to a Jewish convert! I asked
the sheik to attend with us as one of her next akin;
for I believe him to be a son of Azrael, though he
denies that parentage, as well he may, since the
‘Angel of Death’ was strangled at Bagdad for treason.
Be assured, Miriamne, the young Mohammedan will
not be present at our ceremonies to-night!”</p>

<p>“Will wonders never cease?” spoke Cornelius, at a
loss to know what to say.</p>

<p>“No. Let us be going now,” abruptly spoke the
Hospitaler.</p>

<p>“Do you return to the city so soon?” queried Miriamne.</p>

<p>The question was answered indirectly:</p>

<p>“Let’s to the temple, or ‘House of Bethesda.’ I’ve
taken the liberty to order its illumination. Come, we’ll
see how its jasmines climb on its sturdy walls by the
light of the torches kindled for hymen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, the Hospitaler turned in the direction
mentioned, and all, including the missioners, followed
him. The scene was fairy-like. There were lights and
flowers and songs. The feasters from Jerusalem were
in holiday attire, and those of the villagers that joined in
the concourse were hearty participants in the festivities.</p>

<p>Arriving at the temple, the Hospitaler led Beulah
toward the speaker’s dais.</p>

<p>“Will not the camel-driver enter?” questioned the
knight of a companion.</p>

<p>“No; he’s half way back to the city by this time.”</p>

<p>“Stand by thy other self,” said the knight to the
Jewish groom.</p>

<p>The latter obeyed with alacrity; his zeal and his
bashfulness precluding grace of action.</p>

<p>“Four hands clasped; crossed,” said the Hospitaler.</p>

<p>The twain did as commanded, the youth with
avidity, the maid with a timorous, modest reserve.
The touch of each, electric to the other, was recorded
in their faces, over which passed rapidly a poem of
emotion. The audience became silent, hushed by
admiration akin to adoration. The old, old, yet ever
new, ever-entrancing spectacle of love’s full crowning,
brought to all minds the splendor and holiness of that
royal gift which finds in earth its completest unfoldment
in wedlock. Each of the auditors, conscious of
admiration of the presentment, was also conscious of
self-approving. There is a cleansing of conscience like
that which follows prayer in the act of heartily approbating
the thing which is good and beautiful. With
the espoused for his inspiration and his background of
light, the Hospitaler, with his usual abruptness, began
addressing the assembly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You of the East hear best when your eyes are treated
together with your ears, hence I speak at this time, most
propitious, of themes pertinent. You have heard how the
ancient Romans named this month, deemed by them favorable
to marriage, Junonius, in honor of their chaste and
prudent goddess of conjugal life. She was the <i>Hera</i> of the
Greeks, the only lawfully wedded goddess of all their
mythologies. The myths prove that those pagans discerned
the potency and beauty of holy wedlock. They polished
jewels and wove girdles for its personifications, and to-night,
in this temple dedicated to womanhood at her best, I’d take
the girdle and crown and place them upon the Queen of
Women, the peerless Virgin. For such a real woman the
ancients were seeking when they had their dream of the
myths. She was what they yearned for, and her exaltation
as the representative of all that she truly did represent, will
be found of lasting profit to all. Behold her, an orphan
girl, yet by faith having an Eternal Father. As a girl, abhorring
waywardness; as a woman, therefore, free from wantonness.
Mark me, ye maidens, the wayward becomes the
wanton. Coquetry brushes the down from the cheek of
the peach, and she that frivolously plays with passion in the
morning will be likely to seek the groves of Astarte at noon.
Our ideal woman reached maidenhood’s roses all portionless,
as world-help is counted, but with the inestimable
affluence of prudence, constancy and purity. Thus she set
the finest youths of all Jewry to striving for her heart and
hand. What Juno was to Rome, Mary was to Israel. The
Romans proclaimed their faith in the good wife as the producer
and conserver of wealth by putting their mint in
their temple of ‘<i>Juno-Moneta</i>.’ The carpenter of Nazareth,
building up a clean, honest, though humble home, by the
aid of his consort, built more enduringly, and presents a
finer historical figure, than that once mighty, once wise Solomon;
though the latter erected the wondrous Temple. The
home and love of Joseph and Mary will be praised by the
ages that abhor the ivory houses of pleasure of the great
and fallen king. The story of that home life at Nazareth
has not been written, and we must gather it from fragments
and eloquent silence. Mary’s jewels as a wife were unostentatiously
treasured within the four walls of her domicile.
The devastating tornado leaves enduring, though hateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
history; but the constant, man-blessing tides of the ocean
come and go without having their recurring blessings recorded.
So the constant, loyal, patient woman of Nazareth
passed noiselessly by in her day. Her exclamation to the
Angel of the Annunciation, ‘<i>Behold the handmaid of the
Lord, be it unto me according to thy word</i>,’ was the keynote
of that life ever enhanced by the beauty of duty. There
was submission to right because it was righteous. And this
was not mere passiveness. You remember how she challenged
her Son in His early youth, that time He was absent
for a season from His parents, at first without explanation?
The words Mary spoke that day burn like polished gems
when considered aright: ‘<i>Why hast thou dealt thus with us?
Behold, thy father and I have sought thee, sorrowing.</i>’ She
did not forget her Son’s divine origin, but exalted the rights
of motherhood and fatherhood, confident that even Deity
could not ignore them. She challenged the right of a son
to cause parental sorrow without instant strong reason for
so doing. She put her husband’s cause before her own, and
made his honor her sacred wifely trust. There are in this
history some very fine things expressed by implication. We
know the woman was beautiful and much younger than her
husband; the disparity of years did not hinder full affinity.
She did not fall into the weakness of feeling self-sufficient
and all-complacent because feeling pretty. All she was and
all she had was centred in her consort as a commonwealth
between him and her. That the sycophant and flatterer
crossed her path there can be no doubt; but she who was
not intoxicated by Bethlehem’s <i>gloria in excelsis</i> could not
be dazzled by the honeyed words of mortals. Wearing such
a wife on his heart, Joseph was rich indeed. Silence is
once more eloquent. We know that the mother of Jesus,
having been widowed, never wed again. Her first love suffered
no eclipse. That she was courted, after her spouse’s
death, we must believe. The mother of a Son so famous
as was hers, and the possessor of personal charms enshrining
a soul that knew how to utilize sorrows until they became
refinements, doubtless had many suitors in her widowhood
days. And there was no law forbidding her a second marriage,
except the unwritten law of fine sentiment; but to
the Queen of the House of David the law of fine sentiment
was all-controlling. All her heart was filled with love for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
her husband, her Son and her Savior. When her consort
died, the niche in her heart that he occupied, the only part
with room for conjugal love, became a shrine. Its door was
sealed then until the final resurrection. Where such constancy
exists there is certainty of pure homes. Sanctity,
chastity and faithfulness were the lights of the temple,
dedicated to the mythical Juno, within whose precincts no
impure woman was suffered to enter. To-day I claim for
the True Ideal all that was accorded the mythical one.”</p>

</div>

<p>When the speaker paused, some of the men present
broke forth, as was the custom in the synagogue service,
with an “Amen,” and some exclaimed “Rabbi,
thine are good words for our women to hear!”</p>

<p>The Hospitaler’s black eyes flashed; a hint of retort
of lightning-like directness to come. And it came, instantly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I shall fail of my duty if I give all to one-half. I shall
fail of my intent if my words seem like railings at the sex
most tender, most burdened. Since we are treating of the
weeds of the mourners, let us question why it is that widowers
more frequently seek remarriage than do widows.
The bereaved man easily says: ‘Get me another wife.’
The bereaved woman more frequently says: ‘Let me hurry
on heavenward after my only and ever beloved.’</p>

<p>“With the true woman marriage is a committal so utter
that it is difficult for her, generally, to make it more than
once. Again me thinks that marriage brings the graver,
heavier loads to women. Once experienced, there is need
of a mighty love to allure her to a second trial. The man
rises by self-assertion, and wedlock does not hinder him.
With the woman wedlock means self-denial; her name
changes, her career is merged into that of her consort; her
body is given, literally, to the new beings she bears. To
woman marriage has no parallel, except death. Her only
possible compensation is love, and that she should receive
with measures knowing no stint. Oh, men, all fair to other
men, all merciful to the beasts that toil, all prudent in keeping
in motion, by day and by night, the water-wheels in
your orange and mulberry groves, be fair and merciful to
your consorts. Yea, and evermore water with love’s most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
grateful refreshments the bearing vines whose tendrils intwine
your hearts, whose fruits enrich your homes. This is
religion; what is less is heresy, and he who deals unkindly,
cruelly or niggardly with his other self, can not face God.
The prayers of such are hindered and like unto a tree whose
leaves are storm-stripped. You know the race, by birth,
comes forth in two sexes, of equal numbers, a hint of God’s
plan to have mankind live as pairs; but the men are a constant
majority. Why? I answer that, notwithstanding the
perils falling upon the sterner sex, by exposure, by war, and
all such things, the trials falling to woman’s lot work the
greater havoc, keeping her sex in huge majority in the
places of the dead. Now you praise me, because I’ve told
your women to be like the glorious Mary? Praise me
again for telling them, as I do this instant, to be like her
in choice of consorts. If they can not find Josephs to begin
with, God grant to make the men they have like the choice
spouse who fell to Mary’s lot!”</p>

</div>

<p>The Hospitaler paused for a moment; there was a
wave of excitement, very near to applause, running over
the audience. The bride and the groom, together with
all the women present, by their faces expressed their delight.
The men who had exclaimed at the first, looked
blank and kept silent now.</p>

<p>Abruptly, as before, again the knight spoke:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I’ll touch now another pertinent theme—<i>Mary under the
shadows of scandal!</i> I’d exalt her as one having sounded
the depths of woman’s misery, and yet preserving her integrity.
I know that some here will think themselves offended,
since it’s the fashion so to think when listening to discourse
such as I now intend. Society, more prudish than sincere
or wise, has demanded that the burning, scarlet, social wrong
be spoken of only by scrupulous hint, half words and reserves,
at least among decent and happy folks. For once,
as God’s accredited ambassador, I’ll change all this, and by
Purity’s earthly throne, the marriage altar, denounce the
crime of crimes, the blasting curse of all mankind. Let him
that’s conscious of his own impurity mince words. I’ll not!
Jehovah might have brought forth the Christ without subjecting
Nazareth’s Virgin to the painful necessity of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
doubted. It was as He decreed and wisely ordered. The
happening was not because Deity was frustrated, but because
He knew that she whose example was to be woman’s inspiration,
could be so more surely, if her career took her along
all lines of woman’s needs. There was a time when almost
all who knew Mary doubted her integrity; a time when her
name was banded about by the roués of her native place;
a time when even her betrothed was resolving to renounce,
if not to denounce her. First I’d speak of how impurity is
abhorred of God, and then of His wondrous effort to allure
those lost by it, as evinced in sending out after them the
two lambs—the Eternal Lamb and the lamb-like woman.</p>

<p>“To say that they whose trend is toward things unclean are
abhorred of God is to re-echo the edicts of nature and history.
They say whenever a sin is committed a devil is
created to avenge it. What legions avenge this sin which,
most of all, brutalizes man and turns all social relations into
anarchy! Ask your men of science. They will tell you
that all the evils flesh is heir to seem to get their seeds
herein. Immortal revenge haunts it! You know, how in
the Christian’s holy book, it is affirmed that many sicken and
die because partaking of the cup of the holy communion
unworthily. Presumptuous hypocrisy thus meets the wrath
which paralyzed Uzzah and Jeroboam. But the cup of the
passion was love’s highest gift, and the offense is not
against the cup but against love in its sublimest display.
Therefore forever death is the penalty that overhangs those
who outrage this finest gem of angels and mortals. Treason
to love is suicidal as well as murderous! They say that
there is a demon whose touch causes hideous, coiling, stinging
serpents to grow from the bodies of those he touches.
I’ll tell you his name—Lasciviousness, and he works fatefully
wherever man abides. But the pure home is an invincible
bulwark against him, and hymen’s torch his blinding
horror.”</p>

</div>

<p>There were some of the knight’s auditors, both men
and women, who felt it their duty, because of custom,
to affect disapproval of the free speaking they heard.
Of these dissenters the women uttered no word, but
their eyes glared, and the color went and came in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
cheeks. The disapproving men exhibited faces as
hard as marble, while their lips mumbled incoherently.</p>

<p>The knight was not slow to perceive the rising
storm, but he was undaunted. He waxed more earnest
and more eloquent; his words and theme inflamed
him.</p>

<p>One favorable to his faithfulness remarked to a
comrade:</p>

<p>“The Hospitaler seems to grow taller, as if filled and
enlarged by an inspiration.”</p>

<p>His face shone as that of Moses when bearing the
law, and some cowered as if they heard coming toward
them, from afar, the rumblings of Sinai. Some white
souls present wept, moved more by the truth in its
beauty and power than they could have been by any
play on their emotions. It was an hour of true oratory’s
triumph; logic set on fire; a consecrated herald
grappling awful sin with the power of omnipotence.</p>

<p>Presently, after the thunder and lightning, came “the
still, small voice.” The man of God spoke with loving
persuasiveness; he healed with words, the woundings
truth had made. Then he carried his audience with
him. Many bowed their heads to weep, as trees beaten
by winds that carried rain!</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We can all entreat fallen men as to most sins, why not
as to the chief sins? We speak to the fathers, brothers and
sons faithfully, pleadingly; why not to the women who are
elect to companion creation’s lords? Alas, the women have
the greater need of helpful admonition, when they fall, for
revilings and black despair fill up the cup of their remorse!
You have heard of the Feast of Lanterns among the Chinese?
Those pagans, once a year, go out with many-colored
lights to symbolize Mercy seeking lost daughters.
Shall God’s choicest people fall behind the pagan? Never,
if true to the noble, tender, pure spirit that emanates from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
God’s own ideal of womanhood. No, no! let us vow with
unwonted zeal, amid the lights, lessons and joys of this
hour, to be knights of new order; knights of the white
cross; sworn to denounce all impure practices on our own
part, and on the other hand to strive to allure the fallen to
that that is clean and white as the souls of the angels which
do excel! Let us go to those whom sin has made drunk,
in their despairing. Let us tell them that doubt castles are
stormed! Let us proclaim the seed of the woman the serpent’s
destroyer! Go, women to women, in woman’s name,
remembering that pity in the soul makes him or her that
hath it successful suppliant for all mercies at the throne on
which forever the Interceding Son of the Virgin reigns!
Go, fathers, making your fatherhood godlike in its just tenderness!
Go, brothers, sons of women, as pure, strong
brothers indeed! There is many a scarlet woman to-day
with scalded eyes and ashen heart who is so because she
believed men brothers and fathers and found some wolves
and vultures. Go to those who have all days as nights, all
joys as apples of Sodom. They were not always so, and
need not so continue. Do not belittle their sin, yet seek to
allure them by a noble presentment of purity and by all encouragement
to attempt to win back their lost crowns. Tell
them of the woman that stood serenely amid bitterest scorns,
and say as did her Son to one like them: ‘<i>Go, and sin no
more.</i>’ Then teach those who have no such blot upon them
to be kind and helpful. We can never judge any soul’s
guilt until we at last know the measure of the temptation!
God alone knows that.</p>

<p>“I could speak on this theme for hours; but this is
enough! The story of Mary has somehow ever had peculiar
efficacy with the blighted of her sex. They easily are
led, when all men fail them, to dare to trust the One who had
a mother so tender. Many a motherless outcast has found
Christ in trying to find mother-love in Mary. After the
phantasmagoria of illusive pleasure it is healing, through
faith in God’s exemplified love, to dream of how it seems
to have a real mother’s arms enfolding one. I hold that it
is profitable to the impure man, sometimes looking within
the Pantheon of memory, to find therein conceptions he
treasured in his purer days; but with more determined
assertion I find that it lifts up the soiled woman to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
in contact with the girdle of power and crown jewels of
that maiden and mother of Nazareth and Bethlehem. It
was she that stood against imperial Rome, in the person
of Herod; a chaste young Jewess against corsleted animality;
a country maiden, heaven-endowed, against an old
fox; the loyal mother-eagle against the python! But
she that was simply good evaded, outran, soared above,
and finally confounded the evil at its lowest dip, its
highest power!”</p>

</div>

<p>Then the orator-knight, waving his hand to Cornelius
to signify to him that the missioner was to conclude
the ceremonial, abruptly closed his address and
retired to one of the little alcove-chapels.</p>

<p>A simple espousal service followed, and then the
company gathered dispersed, going to join in hastily-arranged
festivities in the park by the temple. The
Hospitaler and the missioners were auditors.</p>

<p>“Nourahmal, I can well believe, was a rare beauty;
her grand-child has her features, and she’s a vision.”</p>

<p>“What time my friend here, the Hospitaler, did not
engage me I was admiring the groom,” Miriamne responded
to her husband.</p>

<p>“He hails from the Jabbock country,” remarked the
knight.</p>

<p>“Jabbock? Faithful Ichabod’s native place?” exclaimed
Miriamne.</p>

<p>“He was the groom’s uncle,” quoth the knight.</p>

<p>Then the trio were silent, the thoughts of each following
back over the past years and along God’s providences.
The way life’s lines were crossed, interwoven
and entangled seemed to each very wonderful.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“I’m anxious for the coming of the people
to-day; Beulah said, a week ago, at her
wedding, that she’d have the old Druse
camel-driver at this service; though he ran
away from her marriage feast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve heard that she and her grandmother had a
convert to our faith, nearly ripe,” replied Cornelius to
his wife.</p>

<p>At this instant one of the “Bethany Sisters” timidly
approached the speakers, evidently anxious to
deliver some communication.</p>

<p>“’Tis ‘Brightness’ by name and by nature,” remarked
Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Well, sister Ziha, what is it?” questioned the
chaplain.</p>

<p>“Pardon me; but there is waiting without, a grave
and taciturn man who says he would speak with the
‘Prophetess.’ He means our Miriamne.”</p>

<p>“Of what flavor is he, Ziha?”</p>

<p>“Surely, I can not imagine, sister Miriamne! His
countenance is that of a Persian Jew; his turban is
Turkish; his tunic Christian. But his bearing is that of
a prince, though all his belongings, except his gorgeously
dressed camel, are those of a beggar!”</p>

<p>“I’ll see him, Ziha; bid him enter,” exclaimed Miriamne.</p>

<p>“That I did; but he says his haste is too great and
his limbs too stiff for dismounting. In truth, his brow,
bleached to the bone, tells of weighty years.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go to him,” said the chaplain.</p>

<p>The missioners going forth, at the easterly side of
their temple, were confronted by a majestic figure,
mounted on a splendidly caparisoned white camel, evidently
a borrowed one.</p>

<p>“<i>Ullah makum</i>,” “God be with you,” said the man
on the camel with great courtliness and dignity, at the
same time extending to the chaplain a parchment
roll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span></p>

<p>“This for me?” questioned the latter.</p>

<p>“For thee,” replied the rider, bowing as before, but
looking past the question with fixed, though reverent,
gaze at Miriamne.</p>

<p>“But who are you?” again questions the chaplain.</p>

<p>“God knows,” was the sententious reply of the
rider, his eyes still turning, not with curiosity, but with
a deferential and affectionate interest, toward the
chaplain’s wife.</p>

<p>“What message here, my father?” questioned again
Cornelius, in the language of Galilee.</p>

<p>The aged man’s dark face lightened at the words,
and turning his reverent gaze from Miriamne toward
the questioner, he slowly responded:</p>

<p>“The ‘Angels of the Mount’ are not too proud to
call a poor camel driver ‘my father?’ Age has respect
here! I might have known this: Nourahmal is full of
the odors of this new Bethany!”</p>

<p>“And do you come from Nourahmal?” quickly
interrogated Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Nourahmal and I are one, by the voice of God
spoken through the holy Hospitaler, who is alluring
me daily from the secret faiths of my fathers to learn
the prayers that Nourahmal learns here.”</p>

<p>“I see,” continued Miriamne; “I speak with Nourahmal’s
consort. Pray dismount for refreshment. We
bid you every welcome, Mahmood.”</p>

<p>“Mahmood! called by such fine people by my proper
name; not ‘dog’ or ‘here you,’ or ‘old camel goad!’
Wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Will Nourahmal’s spouse dismount?”</p>

<p>“Blessed woman, I’ve had great refreshment in
being thus permitted to see thee face to face, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
thank thee and thine for what thou hast done for me
and mine; but I can not tarry; old age and poverty
have bargained to make constant toil my master. I
must keep moving or the swifter youths will take away
my master and leave me to hire out to starvation;” so
saying, the speaker smote his camel and the beast
moved away, slowly, along the road toward Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Cornelius, recovering himself from his meditations,
called after the departing Druse.</p>

<p>“What of this parchment?”</p>

<p>“The Hospitaler sent it! He said it would talk
with ‘the Angels of the Mount.’”</p>

<p>The camel driver had stopped his beast to say this
much. For a moment he looked at the missioners,
then at their temple and its surroundings. There was
a world of questioning, and wonder, and yearning in
the old man’s countenance. Again his goad fell on
the beast he rode and the latter bore him along.</p>

<p>“Shall we meet again, father?” Cornelius called
after him.</p>

<p>“Stay master work! Go master want! ’Till good
shade Death takes to the cool rest-land the holy Hospitaler,
the Angels of the Mount, my Nourahmal, and
may be me; even me the poor, old, camel-driver, Mahmood!”
was the slow reply as the Druse departed. A
turn in the road soon shut him from view.</p>

<p>“Well, my spouse, Miriamne, our new Bethany sees
strange visitants these days,” remarked her husband.</p>

<p>“The mystic Druse is finding something that is finer
than the creeds of his mountain clans,” rejoined Miriamne.</p>

<p>“Be not too certain; those Highlanders of Palestine
are ever politic; they’ll quote the Koran to one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
Islam, kiss the Bible in the company of Christians; but
once alone are Druse to the last.”</p>

<p>“That is their character; but we’ve a transforming
gospel; no man as old as he and companion of such
advocates of the White Kingdom as the Hospitaler
and Nourahmal, could talk as did that old man to kill
time or conventionally.—But you do not study your
parchment.” Cornelius, recalled by Miriamne’s words,
unfolded the document given him by the camel-driver,
and read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My son and my daughter: Greeting; the streams of
gospel blessing rising in the springs of your mountain
temple reach refreshingly even unto Jerusalem, as I daily
perceive. Therefore, for your consolation and for the
enkindling of your pious zeal, I herewith send these lines.
Work onward, beloved, believing, hoping you have arrived
at the dawn of a new revelation and well commenced a true
work for God. To-day, as I sought to interpret His prophecies,
it came to me that that you are attempting to do is
nigh to being a fulfillment of His word as recorded in the
manner following by Ezekiel:</p>

</div>

<p>“Then the glory of the Lord departed from off
the threshold of the house, and stood over the
cherubim.</p>

<p>“And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and
mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they
went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every
one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord’s
house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over
them above.</p>

<p>“The word of the Lord came unto me, saying:</p>

<p>“Thus saith the Lord God: I will assemble you out
of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I
will give you the land of Israel.</p>

<p>“And they shall come thither, and they shall take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
away all the detestable things thereof and all the
abominations.</p>

<p>“And I will give them one heart, and I will put a
new spirit within, and I will take the stony heart.</p>

<p>“That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine
ordinances, and they shall be my people, and I will be
their God.</p>

<p>“Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the
glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</p>

<p>“And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst
of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on
the east side of the city.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These solemn words tell how the glory and favor of
God was driven from the people of old by their sinning;
how slowly, yearningly, God departed; how in every land
He provide <i>little sanctuaries</i> for the faithful few. And
more than all this, the Holy Word describes God in Spirit as
pausing on the mount to the east of Jerusalem. That pausing
place was your Olivet. The Jewish Rabbins in their
sacred histories affirm that for three years God, in manifest
form, tarried, near where your Temple of Allegory stands, repeating
over and over the solemn call, ‘<i>Return unto me, and
I will return unto you!</i>’ Beloved, since then the eternal
voice, through Jesus Christ, has spoken through three ministering
years from these mountains to the world. You are
now re-echoing the cry. God be with you, as He is, and
give you faith to call and call until the ascended Christ
come into all hearts.”</p>

</div>

<p>“No name to his letter, as usual?” remarked the
chaplain.</p>

<p>“He seems to loathe names almost; but recently,
when I made bold to ask him his, he sententiously observed,
‘God knows; ’tis in a white stone, I’m to get;
for this life I’m only remembered by what I’ve
done.’ But what engages my husband’s attention
now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m trying to interpret the picture yonder, over the
door, to the retreat you call the ‘<i>Mother’s Pillow</i>.’”</p>

<p>“What think you of it? You perceive it’s the legend
of the mother pelican feeding her famishing young
with blood drawn from her own bosom, which she has
wounded for their food.”</p>

<p>“I think the picture likely to depress nervous
mothers!”</p>

<p>“That’s a picture of one side of mother life; look
beyond it.”</p>

<p>At that the light from a distant window was let fall,
by some unseen attendant, all about the entrance to the
“<i>Mother’s Pillow</i>!”</p>

<p>“I see a splendid ‘Gabriel’ above the pelican; the
angel’s hand points upward.”</p>

<p>“Glorious Gabriel! Angel of mothers and victories,
by interpretation, ‘God’s champion!’ You’ve heard
his titles, Cornelius?”</p>

<p>“I know that he bore victory to Gideon and lightened
the way for Daniel’s conquest of all Babylon;
nor do I forget that he was the angel which comforted
giant Samson’s mother before her child was
born.”</p>

<p>“Yea, he that made the sign of the cross, doing wondrously,
above the smoke of Monoah’s altar, was after
commissioned to greet and guide Mary, the mother of
the Giant King of the new dispensation.”</p>

<p>“You’ve fine insights, Miriamne, but there’s incompleteness
in your symbolism here.”</p>

<p>“True, I feel that; all interpretation of motherhood
is inadequate; but look further.”</p>

<p>“I see the ‘Queen of Mothers!’ Why have you left
her and the babe in such deep shadows?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s this life’s reality; but look higher.”</p>

<p>The chaplain complied; a vine trellis was swung
aside, and he beheld, above the shadowed picture, in
an arch reaching nearly to the roof of the temple,
another, the latter a marvel of light and color.</p>

<p>“Glorified Mary, uplifted by the babe, now grown
and Kingly!” exclaimed the chaplain.</p>

<p>“And so is taught for mothers’ comfort, that the Son
of God honored her who bore Him, because she was to
Him a true mother. May we not believe that this love
for Mary, in the God heart, is widened into peculiar
tenderness toward all who give the earth its lords and
paradise its elect through the crucifixions of maternity?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miriamne, I’ve learned in the past to stand, as
it were, with bared head, all reverential in the presence
of true motherhood; when I see it strengthened by
faith, enriched by suffering; the most entrancing example
of self-abnegation on earth! To-day I feel, if possible,
in these surroundings, a deeper reverence than
ever, for that estate of woman. Say on.”</p>

<p>“Paganism worshiped the sun, the earth, woman;
whatever brought forth; it was its best attempt at expressing
a vaguely realized yet noble sentiment. The
religions that repudiated paganism, in their efforts to
extirpate all idolatry, went to the extreme of denying
merited honor to some most worthy. Then came the
Christian revolution, and God turned all eyes toward a
pure woman. He proclaimed forever the honors of
motherhood by presenting through it to the world His
Unspeakable Gift.”</p>

<p>“So heaven’s last appeal to our race, after Sinai’s
thunders and the rapt visions of the prophets became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
ineffective, was made by the eloquence of the life of
the silent Mary.”</p>

<p>“Well said! Now filled with that belief, herald the
White Kingdom!”</p>

<p>“I’ll help Miriamne, encouraging, upholding her;
for the rest I’ve learned to lean and follow.”</p>

<p>“I’m a column of dust, not a pillar of fire; and dust,
alas, to dust returns. There is much to do here, more
than I shall be able to compass. I’ve hitherto but
vaguely taught the meaning, power and blessings of
motherhood.”</p>

<p>“I think more than vaguely.”</p>

<p>“The sun rises in the east. I think we’ve sunrise,
but the depth, height and breadth have not been
sounded nor measured yet. Shall we go toward the
west wing?”</p>

<p>“Yea, lead, though I’m charmed in this presence.”</p>

<p>“I’d lead to the ‘<i>Rest of the Aged</i>.’”</p>

<p>“To the retreat with door like a castle? What are
those amazon forms in armor?”</p>

<p>“The Peri?”</p>

<p>“I bid them welcome in Miriamne’s name, having
learned that she is serious as well as cunning in weaving
the manna-bearing garlands of every myth about
her ideals. Say on.”</p>

<p>“They say there is beneath the Caucasian mountains
a wondrous city builded of pearls and precious stones,
in which dwells a race of surpassing beauty of person.
I’ve utilized the tradition.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the fabled Peri; but I’m mystified.”</p>

<p>“They also say,” continued Miriamne, “that Dives,
a wicked genus, wages constant war against the Peri,
hoping to possess the treasures of the Peri capital, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
that they successfully repel him and make their
happiness secure. I have a similitude of the Peri
city.”</p>

<p>“In truth, I wonder now. What fitness for such an
allegory here?”</p>

<p>“I think I have come near to a profound truth.
Listen; here at the west, I have planned to show what
makes approaching age a terror.”</p>

<p>“There are many evils which fall upon man’s declining
years.”</p>

<p>“Judge me if my philosophy is faulty. I see ever
that the fear of being left poor and also old here haunts
most lives. This fear is the parent of avarice, and
avarice is a serpent of glowing head and deadly sting.
It robs society and individuals of the two choicest
jewels, plenteous benevolence and serene hopefulness.
You will find that most of the wrongs from man to
man arise from hearts made cruel by the rigors of
avariciousness. If we could stay that master passion,
all streams of benevolence would rise to their flood,
and hoarding, now a seeming necessity, most frequently
a curse, become the occupation solely of a few
monomaniacs.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne’s philosophy is as invulnerable as a
knight’s hauberk, but how can you make it a general
practice?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very easily. I’ve planned to endow our Temple of
Allegory so that it may not only teach but also
do beautiful things. I’d have it a Pool of Bethesda,
stirred continuously to meet every human need.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne will have a vast following; the masses
believe in loaves and fishes!”</p>

<p>“True, avarice prompts some to a mean faith, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
I seek to slay avarice and blast the love of money, that
root of all evil.”</p>

<p>“‘Enthusiast!’ a gainsaying world will cry.”</p>

<p>“And the cry of the world will be then, as often
before, a burning lie! So be it. I’m holding up the
truth, the royal truth of Christianity. I’ll hold it up
while I have breath, and leave that truth, if God gives
me grace, as the beacon light on our hill to glow until
all Christendom puts on a charity as multiform and
broad as the needs of humanity.”</p>

<p>“But there is a large and needy world.”</p>

<p>“I have a rich Father; the earth is His and the
fullness thereof. The only difficulty is in securing
from His stewards an accounting and a beginning of
payment.”</p>

<p>“This, Miriamne, sounds like the dream of a poet.
I’ll not waken you from your beautiful trance, but
still the rough fates of life as it is, and the very common
commonplace confront us.”</p>

<p>“What a world this would be if all mankind was as
one family, realizing universal brotherhood!”</p>

<p>“This, too, is the dream of the poet, Socialism;
Astarte’s devotees practiced it in the past.”</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll say silence! You speak of heathen socialism.
Whatever its form, lust was its corner stone,
and a barbarous selfishness, which limited it to those
of each tribe or clan, its best expression! I speak of
a vastly finer, grander creed! I look out and forward
to a day when all shall know the Lord; a day when
law shall be love and love shall be law. Then earth
shall be an Eden, with plenty for all, such plenty as
Divine bounty bestows. Christianity means the bringing
in of that day; the ‘Precious Gift’ was an earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
of all needed gifts from on high. When that day
comes we shall understand why the Pentecostal fire
came to all hearts in the time when all worshipers
were thanking the All-Giver for the bounties of the
harvest. Then avarice shall cease from the earth, and
men, no more harassed by it, learn to practice all
bountifulness in youth and mid-life, and also serene
restfulness when their powers of bread-winning are
paralyzed by the burdens of years. All will be noble,
therefore none indolent. There will be no beggars,
for charity will run before want, ever glad to serve
those that can not serve themselves. Then those who
wear the glory-crowns of gray will be nourished reverently
and gladly, not as if they were useless paupers;
not with a niggardly service which seems to be constantly
saying, ‘How long are you going to live!’
There will be no more worriment, no more crowdings
of each other, no more dishonesty among men! It is,
I say, the constant fear of coming, in the day when
the heart is beating the last strokes of its own funeral
march, to doled charity or to nothing, that makes men
pile up gain in dishonor and hoard it with miserly
grasping. Do you remember that Mary returned from
ministering to Elizabeth to sing her ‘Magnificat’ with
these prophetic strains:</p>

<p>“‘His mercy is on them that fear Him from generation
to generation. He hath filled the hungry with
good things. He hath holpen His servant Israel.’</p>

<p>“From the song she went to humble, painful ministries
in behalf of all the world. Mary supplemented
the wondrous work of her Son and King, all the way
bearing as best she could her part of His cross; all the
way her quivering heart pierced by the sword that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
finally slew Him. She saw His bloody tears turning
to crown jewels as He ascended from Olivet, and with
unfaltering faith knelt among His earthly followers
that she with them might receive her crown of flame.
That room was the highest point of outlook on earth.
It was the place of supreme beneficence; the place
where God gave Himself up freely for His followers
and established the memorial-superlative of the ages.
Thither they hasted that they might learn how all-receiving
comes from all-giving, that they might realize
the measure and splendor of perfect charity, which is
perfect love.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne, whence do you get such wondrous insights?”</p>

<p>Then the young wife turned aside to her “own little
mountain,” as she called a secret praying place in the
chapel. She quickly returned, and handing a manuscript
to Cornelius, said:</p>

<p>“Read, please, of Pentecost.”</p>

<p>He complied:</p>

<p>“Then they that gladly received His word were
baptized; and the same day there were added unto
them about three thousand souls.</p>

<p>“And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’
doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and
in prayers.</p>

<p>“And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders
and signs were done by the apostles.</p>

<p>“And all that believed were together, and had all
things common;</p>

<p>“And sold their possessions and goods and parted
them to all men, as every man had need.</p>

<p>“And they, continuing daily with one accord in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did
eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</p>

<p>“Praising God, and having favor with all the people.
And the Lord added to the church daily such
as should be saved.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hundreds of willing hands, directed by
Miriamne, were engaged in preparations for
fitly celebrating the feast of the Nativity at
Bethany. There was cheerful expectation
everywhere in the village, and the Temple of Allegory
was smiling and glowing by day and by night with
flowers and lights.</p>

<p>“Miriamne, look forth! There approaches our domicile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
a company of singing maidens, wearing holly
wreaths and bearing a kline! What can it mean?”</p>

<p>An instant of wonderment ready to echo the chaplain’s
question possessed Miriamne, then with a glow
of satisfaction on her pale face, she cried:</p>

<p>“I know it all! The maidens of our fraternity have
been declaring for a month past they’d have me this
Christmas at our Temple on the Hill, if they must
needs carry me thither!”</p>

<p>“And they knew you were drooping? Who told
them? Not I.”</p>

<p>“Love has quick eyes, and my sisters love indeed!</p>

<p>“But, Miriamne, you surely will not risk your life,
so precious to all, by going forth to-day?”</p>

<p>“The holly, over-canopying the couch they bear, says
to me: ‘Yea, go.’ I told them the secret of the holly,
and how those ancient Romans, thinking their deities
largely sylvan, cherished this shrub, so persistently
evergreen, in the belief that it afforded a safe and certain
abiding place for their gods in bitter, biting days
of winter. The maidens remember their lesson.”</p>

<p>And shortly after, all went forth toward the temple,
the physically weak but spiritually strong woman
borne by her followers in a sort of triumph, and Cornelius
leading; the latter, that day was one of the happiest,
proudest men in all Syria. He rejoiced and
exulted in being companion of a woman such as Miriamne
was.</p>

<p>Miriamne entered the temple to find a vast congregation
awaiting her. There was a ripple of excitement,
a deep murmuring of satisfied voices almost
reaching the proportion of a masculine outbreak of
applause, as she appeared. Contentment was depicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
on all faces, on many real happiness. Neither was it
transitory; there was a throbbing of gladness running
back and forth, rising higher and higher, until it finally
broke out into an impromptu “<i>Gloria in excelsis!</i>”
Then followed a scripture lesson:</p>

<p>“And Ezra the priest brought the law before the
congregation both of men and women, and all that
could hear with understanding, upon the first day of
the seventh month.</p>

<p>“And he read therein before the street that was before
the water-gate from the morning until midday, before
the men and the women, and those that could understand;
and the ears of the people were attentive unto
the book of the law.”</p>

<p>And now the attention of all was drawn to the
sound of footsteps in the throbbings of a march, keeping
time to the tones of the organ and the flourishings
of cymbals. Nigh an hundred Syrian maidens, wearing
girdles and crowns of evergreen, moved with graceful
evolutions from the temple’s east entrance and
quickly formed in a crescent nigh to Cornelius and
Miriamne. They paused in their progress but still
kept time with their feet and swinging cymbals. Then
the crescent was broken; those in the center standing
in lines that made a cross; those at either end grouping
as stars.</p>

<p>“Sisters, we’d hear the fitting song of this day,”
said Miriamne. Forthwith the gathered company of
garlanded maidens began to retire, but in perfect
order, the two star groups passing along as the company
making the cross went, so preserving the form of
the tableau, until the exits were reached. As the procession
went forth the temple bell tolled solemnly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
and the maidens sang, accompanied by organ-notes
which died away finally like the sigh of tired waves on
a beaten strand. Cornelius was silent, though his eyes
were like the eyes of a child awakened from a dream
of wonderland.</p>

<p>Miriamne penetrating his thoughts remarked:</p>

<p>“Is Cornelius weary of questioning?”</p>

<p>“I listen as to autumn winds in a scared flight through
weeping forests, instead of to Christmas exultations!”</p>

<p>“The singers are of my ‘Miriamne Band,’ as they
call themselves, in honor of the sister of Moses, Israel’s
greatest law giver.”</p>

<p>“Methinks all here are mystics in thought and poets
in expression!”</p>

<p>“Then so was God. We are but reproducing His
lessons! Remember now how the Egyptian Pharaoh
once commanded that all the male children of his
Israelitish captives be put to death, to the intent that
eventually all the females should become the prey of
his people.”</p>

<p>“Miriamne journeys far from Bethlehem.”</p>

<p>“The mother and the sister watched the ark in
which the infant Moses was given to the cruel mercies
of the Nile.”</p>

<p>“I remember, but there come no carols from the
bullrushes.”</p>

<p>“Yea, finer than from the reeds of Pan. Listen; the
ark, emblem of God’s covenant, carried the law. The
mother and sisters, by the ministries of a love which
never faltered, frustrated wily Egypt, saved themselves,
their male companions, and finally their whole race.
When God embalms a history it is well to look into it
for germs of mighty portent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span></p>

<p>“But thinking of this distant and bitter history, we
are kept from Bethlehem, Miriamne.”</p>

<p>“So the Red Sea and the wilderness preceded the
Promised Land. You remember there were fears
and tears before Miriam and her mother saw their
babe safely adopted at the palace; so there were
pains and toils to Mary along the way from Bethlehem’s
manger to Bethany’s mount of Ascension.”</p>

<p>The words of Miriamne were broken off by a strain
of the organ that was very like a moan of the distressed.</p>

<p>“Look yonder!”</p>

<p>The chaplain did as bidden, following a motion of
his wife’s hand, and saw the folds of a huge black curtain
slowly rising from in front of one of the temple
alcoves.</p>

<p>“Woman’s sorrow is tardily lifted!” exclaimed his
wife; then there came to his ears words of human
voices, which were joining in the almost human-like
moanings of the organ;</p>

<div class="verse">“In Rama was there a voice heard;</div>
<div class="verse">Lamentation and weeping and great mourning;</div>
<div class="verse">Rachel weeping for her children,</div>
<div class="verse">And would not be comforted,</div>
<div class="verse">Because they are not.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Rachel and funeral dirges seem still distant from
the songs of the angels in Judea!”</p>

<p>“Rachel is here likened to Mary by the Apostle
Matthew.”</p>

<p>“I liken Rachel to Miriamne: for the former Jacob
served fourteen years which, for the love he bore her,
seemed but a few days. Cornelius could have done as
much for Miriamne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span></p>

<p>“My knightly spouse goes from Bethlehem himself
toward Bethany. Go back now.”</p>

<p>“I listen; lead me.”</p>

<p>“At Rama, the site of the tomb of Mary’s son, the
converted publican, St. Matthew, told how death began
its cruel hunt of the Virgin’s loved Child at His
very cradle. Sorrow envies joy; death battles life, and
ever more woman’s love, the choicest rose of life, has
been crossed by the destroyer of human happiness;
that is human hatings.”</p>

<p>“But how is Rachel so like Mary?”</p>

<p>“A common agony and common needs make all
women akin.”</p>

<p>“I accord great homage to the woman who taught
one so selfish, gnarled and rugged of soul as Jacob was
to love so deeply, as he was taught to love by her, and
yet almost infinitely I separate her from our Rose and
Queen.”</p>

<p>“Rachel died a martyr in maternity and therefore is
worthy of place among the regal women of earth.
She was one of that line of women who gave their
lives for others. The line survives, and suffers through
the years; all-worthy, but not fully honored. Saint
Matthew touched an all-responsive chord when he
voiced the Divine pity for all motherhood, by placing
the sorrows of Rachel and of Mary side by side. The
plain man unconsciously soars to the plane of the
prophets and poets when he is moved by human need
or Divine justice.”</p>

<p>“The lesson is irresistible, but still I’m waiting for
the celestial melodies that awakened the shepherd the
night of the Nativity!”</p>

<p>“My partner shall get by giving. Here is a parchment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
given me years ago to read for my mother’s consolation
after the death of my brothers. Read it, thou,
to the matrons and maidens when the chantings
cease.”</p>

<p>After a time there was silence! the hush of expectation,
for that gathering was wont at times to wait for
words of blessing from the missioners, as the hart for
the rivulet at the beginnings of the rain.</p>

<p>“Read!” whispered Miriamne, “but not as the tragedian!
Read as a father and lover, both in one.”
The young man complied, and these were the words of
the parchment:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There was a man named Jehoikim who, impressed of
God thereto, offered a lamb in sacrifice. As he slew it his
heart was touched with tenderness, and he would have
staid his hand, but God gave him strength to perform the
command. After this a daughter, called Mary, was born to
him. Whenever he looked upon her gentle face he remembered
the bleating lamb, and was certain that some way his
child was to be a sacrifice to God. And it was so; for she
bore a Son to whom she gave all the wealth of a mother’s
love, but at last He was offered for man’s sin upon a felon’s
cross, the agony He felt reaching the heart of his mother.
As the Son gave Himself up for the world, so she gave herself
up for her Son. She was sustained through it all by
a conscience void of offense, and by the ministry of angels.
Alone to the world, she had no solitude, for though her espousal
to God had no human witness, even as Eve’s to Adam
had none, and both were inexperienced, God was at her
nuptials, as He is ever with those who purely give themselves
to Him.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then the wife wept and was silent.</p>

<p>“My darling, what so moves you? I’ve never
experienced such a Christmas. You make the feast as
solemn as the holy supper.”</p>

<p>There came no answer; but ere the husband could
turn to seek a reason it came in a cry from the audience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
and a thronging from all directions toward where the
missioners were.</p>

<p>“Miriamne has fallen!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a swoon?”</p>

<p>“No, ’tis death!” There were surgings back and
forth, voices suggesting helps, voices filled with stifled
sobs, and voices of fright in the trebles of hysteria.</p>

<p>The sick woman was borne by strong men to her
domicile, and then began the tension of waiting. The
young chaplain was entering the valley of poignant
pains by sympathy’s pathway, bound by that mystic
chain whose links are in the words: “These twain shall
be one flesh.” Herein is a mystery often repeated;
the man’s grief was supplemented by a consciousness
of vague pains passing along unseen lines from the
woman to himself. Slowly Miriamne recovered consciousness;
but still she hovered on the confines of
woman’s supreme hour, the hour when great fear haunts
great hopes, great weakness yields to miraculous
influxes of power, and great joy, in company with
unutterable yearnings, moves along under the shadows
and by the gulfs of greatest perils. About her
gathered a group of matrons of her sisterhood, pressing
to serve their beloved.</p>

<p>One whispered to another: “Her face is unearthly,
like Mary’s as we saw it in the ‘Assumption’ to-day.”</p>

<p>The one that heard the words answered with a sob.
The voice of pain called the drooping woman quickly
from her semi-stupor to ministry, and opening her eyes
she tenderly murmured to the woman that sobbed,
“Remember what he said: ‘Women of Jerusalem, weep
not for me; but weep for yourselves and children.’ If
I go ’twill be all well; yes, by His grace, all well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
me. Let all your pity follow the pilgrims of our sex
who tarry to painfully journey through years of trial,
unrequited.”</p>

<p>A little later Cornelius was hastily summoned by
one that sought him, from the shadows of an arch of
the roof, whither he had gone for a few moments’ solitude,
in which to plead, as only can a man who writhes
in the fear of having his life torn in two.</p>

<p>“Miriamne asks for her husband.” He heard the
words and was by his consort’s side instantly. Her
eyes were closed, but taking her pale hand tenderly in
his he impressed a kiss on her brow. She opened her
eyes full upon him, with a gaze of undying love.</p>

<p>“You kissed my brow, the first kiss as a lover. Then
you said it was given in the spirit of reverential admiration.
Has marriage ever changed the thought?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“If I should leave you, do you think you could tell
others how to love so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can, surely; if I can do any thing, alone!”
And then came to him the silence of a dumb grief. She
saw his agony and pitied him, yet serenely she spoke:</p>

<p>“Go onward, beloved, in the way of the prophet’s
vision; the power of Christ be with you; the life of
Mary is an open book; speak to, work for those most
needing, then will you have your constant Pentecost
with the ever present ‘Grail.’”</p>

<p>Cornelius pressed the hand he held tenderly; he
could not speak.</p>

<p>“Repeat to me the beautiful words concerning the
Harvest Feast which you heard out of Moses at the
service that so blessed you at Jerusalem,” she continued
again. Then, mastering his voice, he complied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span></p>

<p>“And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the
Lord thy God with a tribute of a freewill-offering of
thine hand, which thou shalt give <i>unto the Lord thy
God</i>, according as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee:</p>

<p>“And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God,
thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant,
and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is
within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless,
and the widow, that are among you, in the place which
the Lord thy God hath chosen to place His name there.”</p>

<p>When he finished the words he hid his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>“Thou art weary, my good master,” spoke a Jewish
mother present. “Go now and rest. I’ll watch.”</p>

<p>Quickly, gently, firmly he waved her away, as one
unwittingly trying to draw him from the gates of
heaven.</p>

<p>“It is not usual,” she persisted, “for a man to serve
this way; then thou hast other and more important
duties, our holy missioner!”</p>

<p>He found voice to speak, and needed to restrain
himself from indignant tone. It seemed as if it were
impiety now, so great his love, to speak of any duty as
higher than that he had toward this one woman, more
to him than all the world beside. “No; if I were on
the cross she would be there, another Mary; if I am now
in torture I’d be no Christian if I did not emulate Him
who, amid crucial agonies, between two worlds, cried
as inmost thought of His heart, ‘<i>Behold thy Mother!</i>’”</p>

<p>He felt Miriamne’s hand pressing his, and drawing
him closer to herself.</p>

<p>“Cornelius, I’m leaning now as never before upon
my husband’s loyal heart!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to the man as if she were nigh to crying:
“My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!” and
as if to answer his own thought he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“He will be Father, I as a mother, Miriamne, my
Miriamne!”</p>

<p>Grief had made him an interpreter. It was as he
thought, the heart of the young woman, woman-like,
had been groping about for mother-love. Memory
had been busy, but had sent the heart of the woman
back from groping amid the graves of Bozrah all weary,
to nestle and rest on the breast of him that gave
mother-love, and promised all else that loyal heart ere
gave.</p>

<p>But all was not gloomful; the clouds were shot
through and tinted by some light-rays.</p>

<p>“What if our forebodings prove untrue?”</p>

<p>Hope’s question was as a north wind to a desert
noon.</p>

<p>Once the man bashfully questioned his spouse, with
broken sentence that was half signs.</p>

<p>“Does Miriamne feel aught of reproach toward the
great love, seemingly not far from utter selfishness,
which enchanted to this peril?”</p>

<p>“Could Madonna reproach God when she felt the
heart-piercing sword? To Him she submitted, no less
do I in doing and suffering as He wills!”</p>

<p>It has been said a woman’s heart is complex, but
this one’s was not now. It lay open, as a book, before
her lover-husband. He saw no idol there but himself.
Had there ever been hidden remembrance of some
girlish love, some secret scar left by a romance, both
burning and brief, it would have been opened or effaced
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span></p>

<p>As she beheld her consort, this time more loved, if
possible, than ever before, knightly, courtly and tender,
alert and strong to help, lavish in caressing, she not
only felt conquered, but filled with desire to surrender
to the uttermost; for she joyed to place this man
on the throne of her being next after God, supremely
lord over all. So together they moved amid the
flowers of Beulah-land, under the glorious lights of
married love. She all compensated for the pangs the
trying hour brought; he thrilled, as he ascended
higher and higher from lover love to husband love, to
that holy delight that comes to a man beginning to
feel fatherhood, the gift of the woman his heart has
enthroned. For a little time both were too happy to
speak, so they let their thoughts wing their way upward
to the eternities where hopes eternally blossom.
She presently signaled him to draw close to her, then
his clasped hands lay on her heart, and their lips met.
She said nothing, yet by a sign-language well understood
by each, plainly entreated him to tell her over
and over, more and more, his inmost thought, that her
heart knew full well already.</p>

<p>She heard his heart’s beatings, then she whispered:
“Don’t be anxious; all is well, for all is as He that loves
us wills.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miriamne, I loved you never as now; God bless
you! bless you! bless you!”</p>

<p>She interrupted him again. “The crisis is coming,
and I thought perhaps I might not survive, Cornelius,
but if I do not—”</p>

<p>Her words were silenced by an impassioned kiss.</p>

<p>She continued, “I dreamed, last night, that I saw
the shadow of a cross, but on it a woman’s form.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, beloved, do not think of it!”</p>

<p>“I do. I must! I understand it all.”</p>

<p>Pity now silenced her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miriamne!” he cried anon, as he saw her descending
into the vale of agony, from which he could
not hold her back. He dare say no more. He feared
to voice his thoughts, lest his fears become ponderous
and huge, once they found escape in the garb of
words.</p>

<p>Just past midnight the dispatched courier arrived,
bringing twain of the most-skilled physicians of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Cornelius watched them with an interest beyond
words. His heart sank down and down again, as he
saw them in serious consultation. Unable to restrain
himself, he seized the elder, and drawing him hastily
aside, demanded an opinion. The grave old man only
shook his head, saying: “We may save one.”</p>

<p>“One? One!</p>

<p>“Which? What?”</p>

<p>“Young man, be quiet; do not let thy emotions
disturb the patient or the nurses. Prepare for the
worst.”</p>

<p>The husband seized the wrinkled hand of the aged
practitioner, and then flung it from him, crying: “It
must not be! It shall not be!” Instantly he rushed
toward the couch, but the two men of healing intercepted
him. Then the elder one said: “We must be
obeyed, or else we will give no commands! Shall we
go or stay?”</p>

<p>What a revulsion came! It seemed to Cornelius as
if these two men of skill were angels, and flinging his
arms about them, he hoarsely whispered: “Save,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
save! Stay and save! All I have I give you, only
save her!”</p>

<p>Quietly they led him to the adjoining apartment;
then charged him, as he hoped for any good to his wife,
not to re-enter her chamber until sent for. Reluctantly
he consented, not daring to do otherwise and yet believing
in his very soul that in this hour of peril the
bestowment of love’s caresses on the invalid would be
better than any skill of the stranger. He withdrew to
the arch on the roof, where unmolested he could pray.
But his meditations were full of miserable sights. He
thought of the Egyptians in their feats of Osiris, leading
to sacrifice the heifer draped in black; then of Rizpah
defending her relatives; then of the monument in
Bozrah, with the mother holding her dead Son. He
thought, amid the latter meditations, of himself creeping
about that monument, in the night, until he came
to another, on which he deciphered the name, “<i>Miriamne</i>.”
The imagination gave him a shock, and he
gave way to it exhausted. An hour or so after he was
awakened from a sort of stupor by the younger of the
physicians, who, standing by his side, addressed him:</p>

<p>“Sir Priest, thou mayst come now; but as thy profession
teaches, nerve thyself to confront any fate, good
or ill.”</p>

<p>“How’s my wife?” exclaimed the stricken man,
leaping from his couch and approaching the speaker,
that he might devour with his eyes the thought of the
one he questioned.</p>

<p>The emotionless features of the man accustomed to
confront human suffering softened a little to pity. The
quick eye of the missioner discerned the change, then
he cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span></p>

<p>“What, dead!”</p>

<p>“No; if thou wilt but control thyself, thou mayst
see her for a little while; there’ll be a change soon.”</p>

<p>The man of healing had done and said his best, but
that was bad enough. He had tried to comfort, but
the exigencies were beyond human powers. “A
change soon!”</p>

<p>Hard, mocking words. Apology for bad news! Stepping-stone
to saying the worst is at hand; words so
often used by the man of healing when his art is defeated!
How like a funeral knell breaking the heart
has come, again and again, to tingling ears those terrible
sounds: “In—a—little—while—there’ll—be—a—change!”
Cornelius felt all their stunning force, and
was instantly by the side of Miriamne. What a
change met his hungry eyes! The fever had died
away; fever, that blast from the shores of Death’s
ocean, had passed, because there was nothing longer
for it to attack. The tide was ebbing. She lay silent,
pale and haggard; motionless, except as to a feeble
breathing. The husband would have encircled her
with his arms. It was love’s impulse, but science, the
men of healing, restrained him. There was a little wail
just then, and he glanced around with a look of joy.
The nurse had brought the babe close to him, turning
away her own face to hide her tears, but holding the
little one out as if trying to say: “This shall compensate.”
Then again the grief-stricken man turned
to the physicians and whispered, in a half-fierce, half-terrified
way: “She’ll live—she’ll be better now.”</p>

<p>The aged man, slowly adjusting the paraphernalia of
his profession preparatory to departure, replied: “Few
survive the Cæsarean section. It was a dire necessity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lord, behold whom Thou lovest is sick,” moaned
the young chaplain, as he knelt by the couch and
buried his face in its disordered covering. So the tide
of life ebbed at midnight, leaving a stranded wreck at
Bethany, and the Christmas chimes turned to dirges.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hundreds were assembled within the
“<i>Temple of Allegory</i>,” and other hundreds,
unable to effect an entrance, tarried around
about it. The knell of Miriamne, the
Angel of the Mount, had called the vast congregation
together from Bethany, from the country round about
and from the City of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>There were many signs of subdued sorrow, but the
intensive expression of grief common in the East was
absent; neither was there any of the paganish blackness,
which sometimes characterizes Christians’ funerals,
manifest. Though Miriamne was dead, her sweet,
trustful, cheerful spirit still survived and still ruled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span></p>

<p>The knights of Jerusalem, led by the Hospitaler,
were present, the latter to direct the services, by request
generally extended.</p>

<p>After a “grail” song by his companions, and at its
last words, “<i>I shall be satisfied when I awake in His
likeness</i>,” the Hospitaler began discoursing.</p>

<p>“Men and women, death, the leveler, makes us all
akin; therefore all of us feel impoverished by the departure
of the angel who shone upon us here from
the form that lies yonder. Miriamne Woelfkin, daughter
of a knight, consort of a Gospel herald, devoted
friend of womankind, disciple of Jesus, was gifted with
almost prophetic insight and power of alluring unsurpassed
in our day. Hers was the power of a burning
heart entranced of a superb ideal, and therefore was it
the power of immortal influence. She will live not
more truly in the life she died to give than in the lives
she lived to save. She was an unique woman, but only
so because of her superior womanliness. Being dead,
she reaches the reward generally denied the living, full
appreciation. Her career was in part a parallel of her
choice exemplar’s. You have heard how the Mother of
our Lord sung her ‘<i>Magnificat</i>’ out of a heart as free
as a girl’s, yet as proud as that of a woman’s glowing
in the prospect of honoring maternity. But the last
note of her rapture died on her lips full soon, and she
never after in this life rose to such measure of joy.
God permitted her life to pass through a series of suppressions
and griefs, doubtless that she might exemplify
the sad side of woman’s career. The histories
of women, mostly written by men, are marred by the
conceits of their writers, and are at best but obscure
pictures. The man with the pen lacks insight as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
being, whose life is so largely an expression of heart
and soul. The lordly writer clothes his heroes in the
light of his fevered imagination, depicting with bold
stroke the mighty deeds of stalwartness; but he sees
few heroines in his horizon. Those he does see are
beyond his power of analysis. He falls to actual
worship of his masculine demi-gods, perhaps as a partial
atonement for his failings toward the fine and
noble characters whose traits are too spiritual for his
thought-limits or vocabularies. The generality of those
who discourse concerning women, do it in a patronizing
way, and feel to praise themselves as paragons in doing
justice in this, even by halves. The queenship of Mary
is constantly disputed, and so her lot is more closely
linked with that of her sex. As she received the royal
gifts of the Magi, holding them as a sacred trust for
Him to whom her life was utterly devoted, so woman,
the bearer and nurse of the race, gives all that she has
without stint to others. Her life is a suppression; all
bestowing; her reward the joy she has in the lavishness
of her bestowals. Hers is the joy of the fountain
that sings because it flows.</p>

<p>“But recently ye saw the Jewish priests deposit on
his mount, after a custom constant since Moses, the
ashes of the red heifer. They burned their sacrifice
with red wood. Red pointed to the blood that can
only atone for sin. But underneath all lies a deep lesson.
’Twas the female instead of the male thus offered,
and her ashes gave potency to the waters of purification.
I read this hidden truth: the sacrifices of the
gentler sex work out the purification of the race. As
the moss in the heart of the stone, I see this truth lying
in the heart of the ceremonial! As Christ’s cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
precedes the cleansing of regeneration, so woman’s cross
is the means by which the decays of life are offset by
new created beings. By the bier of the wondrous
comforter of others, I may surely appeal to those
who hear me and loved her to seek with quickened ardor
to offer the pain-assuaging myrrhs to those grand souls
who go along the way to life’s crucial glories. I’d have
such justice done as would cause all women to cease
pitying themselves because they are such, and go about
rejoicing that God gave them the superlative privileges
of womanhood.”</p>

<p>There came forth a loud cry, with moanings, from
the part of the temple, called the “Mother’s Pillow,”
where the honored dead lay.</p>

<p>“Miriamne, oh, Miriamne, you brought me through
Gethsemane to your Calvary!”</p>

<p>A silence almost oppressive fell on the assembly. It
was the silence of a pity too deep for words.</p>

<p>Then spake the Hospitaler, in words as invigorating
as a herald of God’s should be, and yet as soothing as
a mother’s to her child in pain:</p>

<p>“Christ, who loved the young man who was very
good and yet not perfect, loves thee, for He is unchanging
in His mercy. Hear me, an old man, stricken
with the years that have schooled, and one who has experienced
the bitterness of widowerhood after loyal, full
loving. God’s hand is on thee. He is schooling thee
to carry on the work begun by thy wondrous consort
now asleep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miriamne, Miriamne! alone in the dark, I move
through Gethsemane toward thy Calvary!”</p>

<p>Again the silence of pity was broken by the voice of
the knight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>“Remember how David of the White Kingdom was
called and furnished for his kingship. ‘He chose
David, also, His servant, and took him from the sheep
folds, from following the ewes great with young. He
brought him to feed Jacob, His people, and Israel, His
inheritance.’</p>

<p>“Missioner-shepherd, God calls thee to a ministry of
love, for those whose trials thou hast now been taught, in
part, to measure. You have heard how Hadadrimmon,
the fabled god of the harvest, ever comes, bearing
sheaves, with tears.</p>

<p>“Thus speaks the prophet:</p>

<p>“‘In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem,
as the mourning of Hadadrimmon.</p>

<p>“‘And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the
family of the house of David apart, and their wives
apart.’</p>

<p>“Young man, God is giving thee a crown in David’s
royal line.</p>

<p>“Once more I turn to her who was thy Miriamne’s
exemplar and queen. Let me tell you all of the last
hours of Mary, that you may find instructive parallels.
I’ll read from my treasured book of traditions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After the ascension of Jesus, our Mary dwelt in the
house of John upon Mount of Olives, and she spent her last
days in visiting places which had been hallowed by her
Divine Son; not as seeking the living among the dead, but
for consolation and for remembrance and that she might
perform works of charity.</p>

<p>“In the twenty-second year after the ascension of the Lord,
she was filled with an inexpressible longing to be with her
Son; and, lo, an angel appearing with the salutation, ‘Hail,
Mary, I bring thee a palm-branch, gathered in paradise;
command that it be carried before thy bier, for thou shalt
enter where thy son awaits thee.’ And Mary prayed that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
be permitted that the apostles, now widely scattered under
their great commission to gospel the world, be gathered
about her dying couch; also that her soul be not affrighted
in the passage through the pale realm of death. The angel
departed; the palm-branch beside her shed light like stars
from every leaf; the house was filled with splendor, and
angel voices chanted the celestial canticles. The Holy Spirit
caught up John as he was preaching at Ephesus, and
Peter, offering sacrifice at Rome, and Paul, from his place
of labor, Thomas, from India, while Matthew and James were
summoned from afar. After these were called, Philip, Andrew,
Luke, Simon, Mark and Bartholemew were awakened
from their sleep of death. These holy ones were carried to
the Virgin’s home on clouds bright as the morning, and
angels and powers gathered round about in multitudes.
There were Gabriel and Michael close beside her, fanning
her with their wings, which never cease their loving motions.
That night a supernal perfume of ravishing delightsomeness
filled the house, and immediately Jesus, with an innumerable
company of patriarchs and holy ones, the elect of God,
approached the dying mother. And Jesus stretched out
His hand in benediction as He did when ascending from the
world, long before at Bethany. Then Mary tenderly took the
hand and kissed it, saying: ‘I bow before the hand that made
heaven and earth. Oh, Lord, take me to Thyself!’ Thereupon
Christ said, ‘Arise, my beloved; come unto me.’ ‘My
heart is ready,’ she replied; a few moments after: ‘Lord,
unto thy hands I commend my spirit.’ Then having gently
closed her eyes, the holy Virgin expired without a malady;
simply of consuming love, permitted now by the loving Creator
to melt the golden cord binding spirit to body. And
triumphantly amid mourners who rejoiced exceedingly in
spirit, the body of this Queen of the House of David was
entombed amid the solemn cedars and olive trees of Gethsemane.
Now, this happened upon the day that the true
Ark of the Covenant was placed in the eternal temple of the
new heavenly Jerusalem, as they say; and the saying is good,
for surely, in her heart, this saintly woman kept the law; the
divine manna as well. Even more, she was the fulfillment
of God’s covenant that a woman should bear the masterers
of sin.”</p>

</div>

<p>The speaker then knelt; all heads were bowed; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
spread out his hands as in benediction, but spoke not.
Yet all in the silence were blessed, for the manifestation
of Christ was there. After the benediction the
companion knights chanted an old grail psalm, repeating
again and again the stately words:</p>

<p>“<i>I am the resurrection and the life.</i>”</p>

<p>As they sang their eyes were turned upward in a
rapture as of men who saw a glorious appearing; and
indeed they had a vision of splendor; but they saw it
within, not without.</p>

<p>“There are angels hovering round,” reverently whispered
Mahmood to his camel. He was too full to keep
silent; too distrustful of his wisdom to confide his
thoughts to a human being. But the thought of the
old Druse was as exalted as that of the Hospitaler, for
the latter exclaimed, as the congregation slowly moved
out to the strains of the organ:</p>

<p>“Methinks I hear the beatings of mighty wings!
Not far away is Gabriel, the ‘angel of mothers’ and of
victories! Yea, verily, I believe that the spirits of
Adolphus, Rizpah, Sir Charleroy and Ichabod are ministering
nigh us!”</p>

<p>Many looked up through their tears fixedly, as if
they felt what the knight had said in their souls.</p>

<p>Then they laid the body of Miriamne in a new-made
tomb nigh the Garden of Olives, not far from the
burial-place of Mary the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>“Behold thy mother!”—<span class="smcap">Jesus to John.</span></p>

<p class="dropcap">Two travelers journeyed slowly along Mount
Olivet, pausing anon to observe the flower-dells
between them and Mount Zion, or to
contemplate the wilder prospects where the
wilderness of Judea edged close up to the hills they traversed.
As the travelers passed, the natives looked
after them with curiosity; for the garments of the
former, though dust-covered, were those of personages
above the ranks of the common people; also of
a fashion that betokened them strangers in that
vicinity.</p>

<p>One of these men was a youth, stalwart and comely;
the other was gray-haired and bent as if by the weight
of years, though a closer view suggested premature
blasting, rather than senile decline.</p>

<p>“Winfred, before entering Bethany, we’ll to the
‘Hill of Solomon,’ the site of Chemosh, the black
image of the Roman Saturn.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the twain turned away from the village
and soon came upon a company of revelers, each wearing
a crown of autumn fruits, and all gathered about
a platform crowded with hilarious dancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span></p>

<p>“Saturnalia!” exclaimed the elder.</p>

<p>“The worship of Saturn ceased ages ago, did it
not?”</p>

<p>“Of the image, yes; but the folly, little changed,
continues.”</p>

<p>“This is strange enough; and yet it’s a relief to
meet a few happy people in this land of solemn
faces; even if those happy ones do joy like fools.”</p>

<p>“They celebrate the passing of summer-heat and
the coming of the rains of autumn. Say not fools;
they are trying to be glad about something good,
somehow coming from some one somewhere above
them. Perhaps God can resolve scraps of thanksgiving
out of it all.”</p>

<p>“Theirs is the laughter of wine! the laughter of
the goat-god, Pan, whose face scared his mother and
whose voice scared the gods!”</p>

<p>“We’ve a persistent custom here, son; and men do
not play the fool for generations after one manner,
at least, without cause.</p>

<p>“These attempt to press into the court of Pleasure
to cajole her; all men do that; these have chosen
merely an old way. They cling to the myth of Saturn,
the subduer of the Titan of fiction. They say
that deity, dethroned in the god-world, fled to Italy,
where he gave happiness and plenty through life, and
the freedom of air and earth after death, which latter he
made to be only a little sleep.”</p>

<p>“That was not more than a mock golden-age; it
never came, I think.”</p>

<p>“But very alluring to those that long for it; they
dance half-naked, typifying the primitive times when
men had fewer cares, because fewer wants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can one laugh hard fates out of countenance, and
make his troubles run with a guffaw?”</p>

<p>“The devotees of Saturn were wont to offer their
children in his altar-fires, and so ever more it happens;
he that bends to the materialistic solely, kindles
altar-fires for his posterity.”</p>

<p>“After to-day what comes to these, peace?”</p>

<p>“Nay, a year all dark and colorless; then another
spasm called a feast—a brief lightning-flash revealing
the darkness.”</p>

<p>“And so the years come and go; one generation
of madmen, then another; death the only variety?”</p>

<p>“Nay! I’d have you look upon pleasure of sense
deified, taking its pleasures under the shadows of
Chemosh, for a purpose. You remember we read together,
under the palms at Babylon, how the holy
Daniel saw in vision the four winds of heaven striving
on the sea?”</p>

<p>“I remember the prophet’s reverie or revel.”</p>

<p>“The four winds and the sea! the meaning, opened, is
conflict on every hand on earth! Out of the follies and
turmoils David’s White Kingdom will emerge at last.
Listen to the words of the inspired seer:</p>

<p>“‘Behold one like the Son of Man! There was given
Him a dominion and a glory that all people should
serve Him; an everlasting dominion!’</p>

<p>“It is coming; my poor faith, amid the conflicts and
revels of man, hears the voice of God crying through
the night, as in Eden’s dark hour: ‘<i>Where art thou?</i>’
My last lesson to my son awaits us at Bethany; let’s
be going.”</p>

<p>Ere long Cornelius Woelfkin and his son Winfred
stood silently, and with uncovered heads, before, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
a little apart from, a stately marble shaft that rose up
amid the olive trees of Gethsemane. It was night,
and they were alone. The father motioned the son
back, and alone glided under the shadowing trees, toward
the pillar. There the elder one threw himself
down on the earth, close beside the monument; the
youth, deeply moved, but unwilling to intrude upon
the scene of sacred, silent grief, stood aloof. In a
small way, there was a repetition of the grief of the
Man of Sorrows, who there, ages before, yearned in His
humanity over a lost world, over those from whom His
heart was soon to part for life. To be sure, the cross
of Cornelius Woelfkin was infinitely less galling, less
heavy than that borne by his Master; and yet it was
as heavy as he could bear, and hence the pitifulness of
his grief.</p>

<p>Who can lift the curtain from his thoughts? The
years roll back and memory’s pictures pass through his
brain, at first in joyful train. The lovers in London;
the betrothal at sea; the wedding at Jerusalem; the
ecstatic consummation in years of marriage. Then
the painful, almost awful separation by death, that
never to be forgotten Christmas time. And then,
twenty years with leaden feet carrying the lone-hearted
man so painfully slow toward death’s portals, for
which he longed with unutterable yearning. “Oh,
Miriamne, Miriamne, let me come,” he cried. The
youth, hearing the agonized utterings, was instantly
by his father’s side. But the old man, still oblivious
to all but his sorrow and his memories, moaned on
with deepening fervor.</p>

<p>“Father,” called out the son. The father rose to his
feet and calmly said: “My boy, pity me. I’m weak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
But oh, you never knew what it is to have your life sawn
in twain and be compelled then to drag your half and
lacerated being along the over-clouded vales of an
undesired existence!”</p>

<p>“My mother’s tomb?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I promised, as my last service to you, to
bring you to it. Its study shall be the finish of your
schooling.”</p>

<p>Just then the clouds broke away and the moonlight
fell full upon the monument. It was a shaft, terminating
in a crucifix; by its side were two forms, one
that of St. John, with face turned toward the figure of
the dying Savior; the other that of a woman kneeling,
her face buried in her hands. On the base of the
cross was the brief sentence: “Behold thy mother.”
As the youth gazed on the farewell charge of Jesus to
John, when He commended to the care of that beloved
disciple His sorrowing mother, he started. It seemed
as if the words had grown out of the marble suddenly
while he was gazing, and for himself only. He felt as
if he could almost embrace the stone.</p>

<p>The two men were silent and heart full. After a long
time, they simultaneously turned away toward Bethany.
They came to a turn in the road that would shut
out all view of the garden of sorrow, and the elder
paused, loath to leave the place where his heart was
buried.</p>

<p>Presently he spoke again, as if unconscious of any
other being with him: “Oh, Miriamne, I failed to
carry out the work thou left’st me! How could I,
alone? I was but half a man without thee, my other
self! Miriamne, Miriamne, I can be only nothing when
I can not be with thee.” Then the old man lifted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
hands as in benediction or embrace, and continued:
“Farewell, a last farewell, sweet, white soul, until upon
the tearless, healing shores of light I say good morning!”</p>

<p>There was a mighty pathos in the display of this
old, ripe, strong grief, which lived on a love that could
not die. The man was a study. He was of fine fibre,
almost effeminate, never firm, except in his affection
for that one woman. That was the one strong trend,
the one anchorage of his life. He need not study the
man far, who strove to know him, to discover that this
tenacity was not natural to him always. It had been
a growth under the influence of the peerless wife.</p>

<p>“Shall we go on?” after a little asked the son. With
a shudder and a suppressed sob the elder moved on,
but with laggard step, which soon paused. Just now,
the moon being beclouded, it was very dark about
them, and the father reached out his hand and drew
the youth to his embrace. He whispered: “Winfred,
son of Miriamne, you bear her image in your face, bear
it ever in heart, as well. I’m glad you’re not so like
me.” The son tried to speak, but the elder interrupted:</p>

<p>“You’ll ere long be fatherless as well as motherless,
but take your mother for your guiding-star. You
know what your birth cost her. By her death you
obtained life, as by the Christ’s, immortality. She
saved others, she could not save herself; but if you’re
true to her memory she’ll have a mother’s immortality,
that life that lives in the life of her child.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us gather up the <i>last</i> threads of our story. After
the death of Miriamne, the “Sisters of Bethany” soon
ceased to congregate at the “House of Bethesda,” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
the city on Olivet. Cornelius Woelfkin attempted for
a time to carry forward the work of the mission, but,
utterly miserable himself, he did not know how to
bestow comfort on others; a man, without the intimate
companionship of the woman who had been his inspirer,
he had no discernment of the needs of woman,
nor power to interpret the truths that were in the Book
or in nature, those garners of manna.</p>

<p>The Hospitaler was sent for as an aid. He came
but once, and then spoke as kindly as he could to the
women of Bethany and Jerusalem, and took his farewell
of them all, in closing words like these:</p>

<p>“The blessed Miriamne, child of Jesus, and emulator
of Mary, has passed away, but Christ her Comforter
and Savior may be such to each of you, that wills
Mary’s example, as the inspiration of all women, can
never die. The world has been a battle-ground, and
each of you can here see over the whole field of conflict.
Shall all pleasures be found under the leadership
of Bacchus and Venus, or in Him that is the God
of Joy? Shall woman echo the passions of man or the
‘<i>Magnificat</i>’ of Mary? Shall the strength that man
seeks be that of the giants, brute force; the strength
of woman be, in her youth the bewitchings of personal
beauty, in old age the cunning of the witch-hag? Shall
it not rather be in the girdle of her moral worth?</p>

<p>“The world needs to seek and find love, beauty and
light. Some go after it, vainly, as did the Egyptian
devotees of Phallic Khem; to whom, with pitiful incongruity,
were offered rampant goats and bulls, decorated
with most delicate flowers. They called Khem the
‘God of births,’ the ‘beautiful God,’ but we know to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
put mothers on the throne as the beautiful; their
flowers, their jewels, their glories being their offspring!</p>

<p>“Women of Jerusalem, never forget the Savior’s own
words to the women that envied His mother, crying
that the one that bore Him and nursed Him was therefore
peculiarly blessed! His reply was: ‘<span class="smcap">Yea, rather
blessed are they that hear the word of God
and keep it.</span>’”</p>

<p>Then the Hospitaler, bending his eyes upon the pale-faced,
widowed missioner, continued: “I’ll tell thee a
tradition of our Lord’s mother. Doubting Thomas,
laggard because doubting, came late to the burial-place
of Mary. He begged to have her coffin opened, that
once more he might gaze on the face of his Savior’s
mother. It was done. But there seemed to be nothing
in that coffin except lilies and roses, luxuriously
blooming. Then, looking up, he saw the spirit of the
woman ‘soaring heavenward in a glory of light.’ But
as she soared, she threw down to him her girdle.
Here is a beautiful parable. The graves of the holy
are to memory full of the ever-blooming roses of love
and the lilies of purity. If we may not have them we
loved with us always, we may have the virtues with
which they engirdled themselves, for our conflicts.”</p>

<p>The Hospitaler paused, cast a glance of yearning
tenderness upon the assembled women and the heart-stricken
Cornelius; then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Long partings are painful. Farewell!” He glided
away ere any could clasp his hand. Not long after this
event the Sheik of Jerusalem, Azrael’s putative son,
raided Bethany, razing the “Temple of Allegory” to the
earth. He was maddened because, after the disappearance
of the Hospitaler, there came to him no stipend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
buy immunity for the “Bethesda House” of the “Sisters
of Bethany.” He despoiled it, hoping to find a treasure
therein, but though there was in and about the
place a great wealth, it was all beyond his grasp or ken,
for he knew naught of the worth or power of precious
truths and precious memories. Cornelius, after this,
taking his infant son, soon departed from Syria. His
dream of evangelizing the world and the great designs
of Miriamne faded from his hopes, as the vision of universal
empire has faded often from the hopes of dying
conquerors. For years he devoted himself to being
father and mother to his child. At last we behold him,
as in the foregoing pages, looking toward sunset.
He stands finally in Bethany, his dismantled home and
Miriamne’s ruined temple not far away, her tomb close
at hand, himself like the fragment of a wreck; altogether
presenting a sad, dramatic tableau. He stands
there as the last of the new “Grail Knights,” the last of
those who in his time were devoted to the new grail
quest. It was Saturnalia-time, and it was night.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
